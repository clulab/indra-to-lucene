Malnutrition is a challenge to the health and productivity of populations and is viewed as one of the five largest adverse health
impacts of climate change. Nonetheless, systematic evidence quantifying these impacts is currently limited. Our aim was to assess the
scientific evidence base for the impact of climate change on childhood undernutrition (particularly stunting) in subsistence farmers in
low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed and gray full-text documents in
English with no limits for year of publication or study design. Fifteen
manuscripts were reviewed. Few studies use primary data to investigate the proportion of stunting that can be attributed to climate/
weather variability. Although scattered and limited, current evidence
suggests a significant but variable link between weather variables,
e.g., rainfall, extreme weather events (floods/droughts), seasonality,
and temperature, and childhood stunting at the household level
(12 of 15 studies, 80%). In addition, we note that agricultural, socioeconomic, and demographic factors at the household and individual levels also play substantial roles in mediating the nutritional
impacts. Comparable interdisciplinary studies based on primary data
at a household level are urgently required to guide effective adaptation, particularly for rural subsistence farmers. Systemization of
data collection at the global level is indispensable and urgent. We
need to assimilate data from long-term, high-quality agricultural,
environmental, socioeconomic, health, and demographic surveillance systems and develop robust statistical methods to establish
and validate causal links, quantify impacts, and make reliable
predictions that can guide evidence-based health interventions
in the future.

were stunted worldwide. In Africa more than 36% of the children
under age 5 y are stunted (7). Lloyd et al. predict relative increases
in severe stunting of 31–55% in West sub-Saharan Africa and 61%
in South Asia, making it an impending epidemic and therefore a
critical research priority (8, 9).
Stunting is a cumulative measure of both acute and chronic
undernutrition and tends not to vary instantaneously in response
to acute conditions such as diarrhea and measles, among others.
However, it is a powerful risk factor for subsequent disease and
death and is associated with 53% of the infectious diseaserelated deaths in developing countries (10). The risk of dying is
increased by 1.6-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.2] in a
moderately stunted child and by more than 4.1-fold (95% CI: 2.6,
6.4) in a severely stunted child (1, 2).
Stunted children also show poor health, delayed milestone
achievements, late school enrollment, poor cognitive and psychomotor functioning, decreased fine motor skills, and poor social
skills (11). Thus stunting affects productivity and may reduce
lifetime earnings by more than 7% (12). Furthermore, children
born to malnourished mothers are at risk for fetal growth retardation (13, 14), small-for-age births (15), prematurity, childhood stunting, delivery complications, and increased neonatal and
postnatal mortality (16, 17). Undernutrition during pregnancy is
estimated to contribute to 800,000 neonatal deaths annually and
to cause 20% of stunting in children under age 5 y (13, 17, 18).
Malnourished children also are at higher risk of adult obesity and
chronic diseases (13, 14).
Significance

|

The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental
Panel for Climate Change propose undernutrition as the most
significant impact of climate change on child health. The question then arises: Where does the empirical evidence to back this
claim come from? Current evidence for the impacts of climate on
childhood undernutrition draws on a limited number of heterogeneous studies with methodological limitations and is based
predominantly on secondary data. Establishing and validating
causal pathways among complex confounding factors remain
the main challenge in quantifying the climate-attributable fraction of undernutrition. Systematically generating evidence from
long-term, high-quality primary data on a range of factors (agricultural, environmental, socioeconomic, and health) at the household level is critical for designing adaptation strategies, particularly
for subsistence farmers.

M

alnutrition is a challenge to the health and productivity of
populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Over one third of the global annual 6.9 million deaths of
children under age 5 y were attributable to undernutrition, either
directly or via their increased susceptibility to succumb to other
diseases (1, 2). Although the proportion of malnourished children
has decreased globally, particularly in China and other middleincome countries, progress has been uneven and slow in subSaharan Africa and India. Moreover, there is evidence that climate change will slow this secular decrease, and it is projected
that a world with a medium-high climate change will have an
additional 25.2 million malnourished children than would the
counterfactual world without climate change (Table 1) (3).
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (4) and the
fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014), malnutrition is viewed as one of the
five largest adverse health impacts of climate change (5, 6).
Malnutrition refers to both undernutrition (underweight, wasting, and stunting) and overnutrition (overweight and obesity) as
well as to micronutrient deficiencies that may occur in both groups.
Our particular concern is stunting (height-for-age being 2 or more
SD below the international median value in well-nourished children). In 2011, an estimated 165 million children under age 5 y

It is important to note here that the largest burden of current
undernutrition is attributed to calorie insufficiency caused by lack
of food intake (1). Food availability (production and supply, trade,
and food aid), stability (demand and supply), access (both physical
and economic access to adequate amounts of nutritious, safe, and
culturally appropriate foods), and utilization (dietary diversity,
child-care practices, sanitation, and annual infectious disease episodes) are four essential dimensions of food security (19).
Changes in weather averages, climate variability, and extreme
weather events (particularly floods and droughts) determine the
quantity, quality, and stability of crop yields (20). The steady rise
in the world population, food wastage, and increasing diversion
of cereal crops to feed livestock will put an additional strain on
food systems. Climate change is likely to reduce agricultural production and affect more than 30% of the farmers in developing
countries that already are food insecure (21). Both Asia and
Africa are projected to experience continuing decreases in per
capita food availability from these negative productivity impacts
(8, 22). Although economic growth may help offset some of these
pressures, declining per capita harvested area affects per capita
food production and therefore creates a deficit in per capita calorie availability (hence leading to undernutrition). The impacts
are borne disproportionately by smallholder subsistence farming
households, as already noted in parts of Africa (23).
Climate change will affect the quality of food crops as well as
their quantity. Recent evidence confirms that elevated atmospheric
CO2 significantly decreases the concentrations of zinc, iron, and
proteins in wheat, barley, and rice but not in sorghum (the main
staple African countries) (24). In countries such as India, where
legumes rather than animals are the preferred source of protein,
these changes in the quality of food crops will accelerate the
largely neglected epidemic of “hidden hunger” or micronutrient
deficiency (24). Micronutrient deficiencies increase the risk
of acquiring an infectious disease. In turn these diseases lead
to or worsen undernutrition, creating an ominous vicious circle.
Worldwide, more than 13% of lower respiratory tract infections
(mainly pneumonia and influenza), 10% of malarial infections,
and 8% of diarrheal infections are attributable to zinc deficiency, and about 27% of preschool children have iron-deficiency
anemia (25).
Empirical studies investigating the correlation of all the factors,
from weather and climate variability to crop yields and undernutrition, are limited. Seasonal (e.g., preharvest and postharvest)
variations in wasting have been studied widely. However, a majority of the previous studies make only partial assessments. We
found only two models that covered agroclimatic analysis to
evaluate effects on childhood malnutrition (9, 26) and one review
assessing the impacts of climate change on pregnancy outcomes
Phalkey et al.

(27). Earlier reviews have investigated the impact of agricultural
interventions or food production and agricultural strategies for
improving outcomes in children’s nutrition and health (28–30), the
impact of climate change on disability-adjusted life years (31), the
impacts of temperature on children’s health (32), the health effects of drought (33), and the effects of climate change on crops
yields (34).
The objective of this review is to document systematically the
available evidence on the association between weather/climate
variables and undernutrition (particularly stunting) in children
under age 5 y. The aim is to understand which weather and
agricultural factors are critical to nutritional outcomes at a
household level to promote interdisciplinary research based on
primary data. We wish to emphasize the importance of building a
long-term and wide-ranging evidence base to inform policy and
to develop targeted adaptation strategies at a household level in
areas in which climate changes are likely to impact agricultural
productivity negatively.
Materials and Methods
Search Methods for Identification of Reviews. A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, OvidSP, EBSCO
(CINAHL, Econlit, GreenFile, and MLA international bibliography), and Scirus
for peer-reviewed articles. Gray literature searches were conducted using
Eldis, AgSpace, Popline (limited to publications), and Scirus (limiting the
searches to preferred web), WHOLIS, and AGRIS [the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Food Policy
Research Institute (IFPRI)].
The key search terms used in combinations were “climate variability”
(weather, climate), “crop yields” (agriculture*output), “malnutrition”
(malnutrition; undernutrition; undernourishment; nutrition disorder; wasting; stunting, malnutrition-related deaths; growth and development; intrauterine growth-IUG; and fetal growth retardation-FGR). The search
strategy was specific to each database. Terms within one concept were
combined using the Boolean operator OR, and combinations between concepts used the logical AND. For peer-reviewed journal databases, these
terms were searched as MESH terms in PubMed, topic field in Web of
Knowledge, subject field in EBSCO, keyword in Scirus, and abstract, title, full
text, and caption text in OvidSP. Gray literature searches were conducted in
all databases of the Eldis. In Popline and Scirus, keyword and free-text
searches were done using combinations, and searches were limited to
publications in Popline and to the “preferred web” option in Scirus. Terms
were chosen according to the specialization of each organization (e.g., undernutrition for WHO and crops and agriculture for FAO and IFPRI). Two
researchers (R.K.P. and C.A.-J.) independently conducted the database
searches in July and August, 2013, with an additional update of the literature in March 2014 (Fig. 1).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Inclusion criteria were set at peer-reviewed
and gray full-text manuscripts in English with no limits for year of publication
or study design. Studies that explicitly made a link between climate/weather

variables and undernutrition (with a focus on stunting, i.e., low heightfor-age) in children under age 5 y, that were conducted in low- and
middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank (with no limitation of geographic location), and that investigated these impacts in rural
smallholder subsistence farmers were included. Studies that focused exclusively on wasting or undernutrition and did not include stunting were
excluded because of greater seasonal variations. Commentaries, editorial
notes, and opinion articles were excluded. Manuscripts that projected
future impacts were excluded from main review but were included as
supporting studies.
Data Extraction and Synthesis of Findings. The PRISMA Statement checklist for
systematic reviews was referred for the review process (35). Search results
were merged, and duplicates were removed automatically, with a manual
second revision. At first stage, title and abstracts were screened. Studies for
which inclusion was uncertain were left for full-text review (Fig. 1). All 81
selected articles were reviewed full-text, data were extracted manually, and
information was documented in a matrix by both reviewers (C.A.-J. and R.K.P.)
independently. Disagreements were resolved with mutual consent.
Data variables included nutritional status [Z scores for height/length-forage (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height/length (WHZ), birth
weight, fetal growth restriction, and small-for-age]; weather/climate/seasonal factors (temperature, rainfall/precipitation, extreme weather events,
seasonality, and elevation/altitude); agricultural factors (farm size, irrigation,
agricultural expenditure, labor, herbicide/insecticide and equipment); crop
factors (crop type, crop yield, crop failure, and crop price); household demographic and socioeconomic factors (household size, composition, food
consumption pattern, income, water and sanitation, aggregate income, expenditure, livelihood pattern, off-farm income, livestock rearing, and maternal
education, among others); and individual factors (sex, age, morbidity, and diet).
In addition the most significantly associated variables in each study were
recorded to assess frequencies.

Results
The review yielded a total of 15 studies (two gray literature and
13 published documents). Experiences from 16 countries (Eritrea, Southern Sudan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mali,
Mexico, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), mainly in the WHOAfrican region, were documented (Table 2). Two studies presented multicountry experiences (36, 37). The studies were
conducted between 1973 and 2008, with the majority covering
the period 1998–2006. Four additional studies (38–41) examined
the link between agricultural variables such as crop yields and
undernutrition without explicit assessments of weather variables
and therefore are included in the supporting text but not in
the tables.
The sample size and the age grouping of children under age
5 y in each study varied greatly and ranged from 41 to more than
18,000 and from age 0 to 66 mo, respectively. A majority of the
studies used secondary data, and only five studies (33%) presented primary data analysis. The main findings from each study
are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. Weather/climate variables
were found to be significantly associated with nutritional outcome (particularly stunting) in a majority of studies (12 studies,
80%) followed by individual demographic variables (11 studies,
73%), household socioeconomic variables (eight studies, 53%),
and crop variables (six studies, 40%).
Because of the differences in the objectives and designs of the
studies included in the review, it was difficult to summarize the
findings. We therefore describe the results in four subsections organized along the impacts of climate/weather variables,

agricultural variables, household socioeconomic and demographic factors, and individual demographic and health factors on
childhood undernutrition.
Weather and Climate Variables. Eight of the studies (53%) investigated the impact of rainfall (level, pattern, and variability)
on undernutrition, and all reported significant associations. It
generally was agreed that variations in the rainfall explain crop
failures, which in turn affect nutrition. Children born in Rwanda
in years with large positive rainfall shocks (increase in rainfall)
showed 0.427 SD higher (P < 0.01) HAZ, and those born in years
with normal rainfall exhibited 0.272 SD higher HAZ (P < 0.05)
compared with those born in years with large negative rainfall
shocks (decrease in rainfall) (42). Grace et al. (26) confirm this
result in Kenya (SD = 0.0007, P < 0.1) but additionally report
that the variations in rainfall and temperature, as well as temperature alone, had statistically insignificant impacts on stunting.
Skoufias et al. (43) observed that negative rainfall shocks generally were associated with taller children if the shock occurred
in the previous year’s wet season (0.7 points higher, for the
central region of the country) or in the dry season 2 y prior (0.54
points taller, for the Pacific, Gulf, and Caribbean region), thus
indicating regional differences. Huss-Ashmore et al. (44) also
found a positive correlation between the average rainfall and
stunting (R2 = 0.155) but noted that the effect operates through
a set of demographic and economic variables.
About half of the studies (eight studies, 53%) investigated the
impact of extreme weather events (droughts in four studies and
floods in four studies) on children’s nutritional status, and all
reported a significant association. Exposure to extreme events
(flood or drought) at an early age (36, 45), for a longer duration
of time (37), and more frequently (46) was considered particularly damaging. Alderman et al. (36) noted that exposure to
drought in the first 5 y of life may contribute to a decline in mean
height of 1% of the median reference in Tanzania. Woldehanna
et al. (11) also found that prenatal exposure to drought had a
significant and negative effect on stunting, particularly in rural
areas (−0.200, P < 0.01) in Ethiopia, indicating regional variaPhalkey et al.

tions in the effect. Children in flooded households in India were
most likely to be stunted and underweight but not wasted (45).
Early exposure also was rated as a higher risk. In contrast, Stewart
et al. (47) did not observe a significant difference in the anthropometric measurements of children from inside or outside the
embankment for the degree of flood damage in Bangladesh, even
in the postharvest season. They report that other factors such as
landlessness and maternal education were significantly associated
with anthropometry.
The seasonality of rainfall was discussed in six of the 15
studies. It was highly significant for wasting in 0- to 35-mo-old
children (P < 0.02 to P < 0.03) and for stunting in 12- to 23-moold children (P < 0.03) and 24- to 35-mo-old-children (P <
0.0001) in Nepal (48). Similar observations were reported from
Papua New Guinea (49), Mexico (43), and the Greater Horn of
Africa (37). Mueller et al. (46) observed high seasonality of
rainfall [odds ratio (OR) = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.60] as a significant factor for stunting and high rain deficit (OR = 1.70; 95%
CI: 1.31, 2.20) and regular inundation (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.14,
1.73) as significant factors for wasting in Papua New Guinea,
thus indicating that weather variables have different impacts on
the different nutritional parameters.
On the other hand, Wright et al. (50) did not observe seasonality as a determinant of underweight children in Zimbabwe.
They instead noted geographic factors, diarrhea, poor household
food access, and increased workload for women during the
weeding and harvest seasons as the main contributors.
Three of the 15 studies investigated the impacts of temperature on children’s nutrition. Skoufias et al. (43) assessed the
growing degree days (GDD) for crops instead of the ambient
temperature and observed that positive GDD (8 °C to 32 °C)
during previous wet season or in the 2 y before the survey had
insignificant impacts on children’s nutrition status. Negative
GDD shocks during the previous dry season were positively
correlated with the prevalence of stunting, particularly in the
central region and at high altitudes. Although the authors were
uncertain if the pathway of the effect was through crop yields or
disease and illness, their findings indicated that the time of the

weather shock, the geographic region, and the altitude were
important determinants in addition to the amount of rainfall
and temperature.
Seven of the 15 studies investigated the impact of elevation/
altitude or relief. Both high altitude and relief were significant
for stunting as well as for wasting and underweight in Papua New
Guinea (46, 49). However, Skoufias et al. (43) report region and
altitude as significant only for stunting in Mexico.
Agricultural and Crop Variables. Agricultural variables mainly included cultivated land area and were reported in five of the 15
studies (33%) and in three of the four supporting studies. Although farm size <2 ha was found to be a significant factor in El
Salvador (38), it was reported as insignificant in Rwanda (42).
Three studies reported that landlessness, damaged plot size, the
distribution of available plot size for crops, and the number of
livestock played more significant roles than the farm size itself
(12, 41, 47). In Malawi, the effects of the size of cultivated land
area varied across regions (P = 0.083). The size of cultivated area
(<0.7 ha) was positively significant for HAZ for children aged
24–59 mo (mean: −2.38, P > 0.01) but not for children aged 6–23
mo (P = 0.329) (40).
Crop yields are a function of the plot size, among other factors. Six of the 15 studies (40%) and one of the four supporting
studies mentioned crop failure/damage or crop yield/productivity
as a significant variable in addition to climate variables. Most
crop damages were caused by droughts or insect attacks and crop
diseases (12). In Ethiopia, postnatal exposure to a crop failure
shock was significantly negatively associated with childhood
stunting (11), and a 10% point increase in the proportion of
damaged plot area corresponded to a reduction in child growth
by 0.12 cm (1.8%) over a 6-month period (12). In Rwanda,
children in households that experienced positive production
shocks at the time of birth had better HAZ (P < 0.01) (42). On
the other hand no correlation was found between household
crop yields and undernutrition in Northern Laos (39) and Bangladesh (47). Kigutha et al. (51) also did not observe significant
fluctuations in weight or height between lean and postharvest
seasons and attributed improved postharvest WAZ to the type of
food consumed. The type of crop grown and the variety in crop
rotations also were reported as important determinants of the
impacts of crop yields on undernutrition in El Salvador (49) and
Papua New Guinea (38).
Household Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors. Household size
(51) and composition (11), especially the number of children
under age 5 y (38, 44), were among the most important household parameters discussed in addition to the weather parameters. Mueller et al. (46) reported that in Papua New Guinea none
of the environmental or agricultural factors were significant
predictors of underweight children, and the socioeconomic status
was the most important factor determining children’s growth
(49). In contrast, no association was noted between household
variables and children’s weight in Swaziland (44).
In addition to weather variables, livelihood patterns were
discussed in five of the 15 studies and in two of the supporting
studies as most important household socioeconomic variables.
Six of these seven studies found a significant association. For all
countries combined in the Greater Horn of Africa, Chotard et al.
(37) observed that the prevalence of childhood wasting was dependent on the livelihood pattern and was 6.7 percentage points
higher in pastoral groups than in agriculturalists. In Kenya, the
prevalence of stunting varied according to the dominant livelihood strategy and was highest in mixed farming zones (26). In
Mali, high prevalence of stunting (particularly in rural areas),

(52). Similar findings were reported from Brazil, where landowners’ children showed better nutritional status than sharecroppers’ and laborers’ children (41).
Four (26, 38, 39, 47) of the nine studies (7 of the 15 studies and
two supporting studies) that assessed the association between
maternal education and childhood undernutrition reported a significant association. Similarly, two (26, 38) of the four studies that
assessed the association between undernutrition and the source of
water (a strong socioeconomic indicator) reported a significant
association. Further, although most studies focused on rural
households (inclusion criteria), five studies investigated the discrepancies between urban and rural. Three of them (11, 48, 52)
suggested higher prevalence of weather-related undernutrition in
the rural areas, one suggested no difference (26), and one noted
urban areas to be at a higher risk (37).
Individual Demographic and Health Factors. After climate and
weather variables, individual factors were the most frequently
reported factors and were discussed in 11 (73%) of the 15 studies
and in all four supporting studies. Age, sex, morbidity status, and
diet were the most commonly assessed individual-level variables.
Eight of the 15 studies and three of the four supporting studies
reported age as a risk factor. Younger children were considered
at a lower risk for all three parameters of undernutrition in
studies from the Greater Horn of Africa (37), Northern Laos
(39), and El Salvador (38) but were at lower risk only for stunting
in Malawi (40). However, they were reported to be at a higher
risk for stunting in a study from Swaziland (44). Six studies
identified specific age groups as vulnerable: 3–18 mo in Nepal
(48), 26–36 mo in India (5), 12–36 mo in Bangladesh (47), 6–24
mo (12) in Ethiopia (11), and 23 mo and older in Mexico (43).
Brentlinger et al. (38) reported that the risk of undernutrition
varied by type and was higher for stunting in the children aged
36–60 mo, for wasting in those aged 12–24 mo, and for underweight in children older than 48 mo.
Five of the 15 studies and two of the four supporting studies
mentioned sex as a vulnerability. However, the results are mixed.
Although female children were worse off in studies reported
from Rwanda (42), Bangladesh (47), and Malawi (40), male
children were at a higher risk in Kenya (26, 51) and El Salvador
(38). In Mexico, Skoufias et al. (43) report that the male children
tended to be shorter but only when exposed to a warmer prior
wet season and who lived at a higher altitude.
All six studies (33.3%) assessing the impact of morbidity (43,
46–48, 50, 51) and the five studies assessing the impact of dietary
factors (37, 46, 48, 49, 51) reported significant associations with
undernutrition. Three studies (46, 48, 52) made a reference to
concurrent micronutrient deficiencies, and all three associated
these deficiencies with the composition of the diet and the seasonality of nutrient availability. Malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections were the most commonly discussed disease
conditions that, along with dietary composition, nutritional quality, and traditional consumption patterns, were factors contributing to undernutrition in children.

Discussion
The UNICEF framework describes a causal chain of factors that
determine childhood malnutrition running from basic factors
(quantity, quality, and control of human/economic/organizational
resources) to underlying factors (insufficient access, inadequate
child care practices, poor sanitation, inadequate health services,
and so forth) and to immediate factors (inadequate dietary intake
and disease) (53). Results of the review confirm that undernutrition
results from a combination of closely linked, interdependent,
complex agricultural, environmental, socioeconomic, demographic,
and health factors at the community, household, and individual
levels (Fig. 2). We note that a large proportion of the mediating
factors are climate/weather sensitive.

Climate/weather variables and individual vulnerabilities emerged
as the factors most frequently associated with anthropometric
measures (particularly stunting) in the children under age 5 y.
Existing studies report that household variables have a stronger
relationship to undernutrition than environmental variables
(54, 55). However, this review suggests that climate and weather
variables play an equally significant role in determining childhood
undernutrition.
More than 80% of the 15 studies included in the review identified one or more climate/weather variables as being significantly
associated with anthropometry. Although rainfall, rather than its
variance or temperature alone, emerged as a commonly discussed factor, the evidence is mixed and inadequate for drawing
meaningful conclusions.
Crop yields determine the quantity and the nutritional quality of
food. Agricultural variables such as plot size, access to equipment
and fertilizers, and crop type and variety have been reported as
indirect determining factors for crop yields (56). However, neither
plot size nor crop yields was associated with anthropometry in a
consistent way in the identified studies. Although the reasons are
unclear, nonfarm income and the nutritional composition of the
food consumed may offer some explanations (57).
Weather variables are significant direct determinants of crop
yields, especially in rainfed farming systems. More than 80% of
agriculture globally and close to 95% of agriculture in Africa is
rainfed (58). Less than a fifth of the cropped agricultural land in
Africa is irrigated. This dependence on rainfall puts smallholder
subsistence farmers, and especially the children in these households, at alarming risks from impacts of climate change on crop
yields and hence on calorie availability. Securing agricultural
productivity through reliable early warning systems for crop
failure may help subsistence farmers offset some of these impacts
and therefore should be explored (36).
In addition to changes in the weather, climate change is expected
to increase both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather
events (6). Needless to say the most vulnerable populations in the
world will be disproportionately affected. The impacts of floods
and droughts on acute malnutrition (mediated through crop
damage or disease) have been well documented in earlier studies.
This review identifies the impact of floods on stunting (mediated
indirectly through loss of livelihood, access to food, and other
factors) in addition to their direct impacts on wasting and underweight (42, 45) and highlights the need to consider stunting in
Phalkey et al.

the planning of acute flood relief programs. Addressing chronic
malnutrition in the development agendas aimed at both climate
change and disaster management is also recommended (11).
We observe that in general a majority of the impacts outlined
in the identified studies were a function of geographic location,
individual factors (such as sex, age, and disease), the anthropometric measure in question, the intensity, time, and duration of
exposure, and household socioeconomic status, among other
environmental factors. All these factors lead to complex but
context-specific individualized impacts. Their consideration is an
essential component for designing future studies.
Methodological Limitations Identified and Implications for Future
Research. We identified several problems with the documenta-

tion of current evidence for the impacts of climate change on
childhood undernutrition. The foremost is the dearth of holistic
studies in the area, even though malnutrition is projected as
being one of the most significant impacts of climate change on
child health. All studies investigated only a part of the spectrum,
or, rather, the jig-saw puzzle, of the variables that determine
childhood undernutrition within the context of climate change
(Fig. 2). Most studies accounted for changes in average weather
conditions, and the role of acute, short-duration weather shocks
in reversible stunting is inadequately investigated.
The review remains statistically inconclusive on a range of
observations, not only because of the complexity of the issue but
also because of the shortage of appropriate studies and the
mixed and inconsistent observations reported. Most of the
studies lacked the necessary methodological rigor, did not follow
uniform methods, and were of varying sample sizes, thus rendering the evidence difficult to summarize, patchy, and incomplete and making any comparisons unrealistic. Ten of the 15
studies reported analyses from secondary data not collected with
the intention of testing the association between climate/weather
variables and undernutrition. All primary data reported (five
studies) were obtained from cross-sectional studies that are inherently incapable of establishing causality. Furthermore, data
reported in a majority of the studies were old (1986–2008) and did
not cover time periods adequate for assessing the impacts of climate change. None provided sufficiently significant evidence on a
wide range of parameters. The lack of robust evidence does not
substantiate the absence of a correlation between climate/weather
variables (other than those mediated through crop yields)

and childhood undernutrition. Therefore, the existing studies have
value in identifying the issues qualitatively, but their results should
be interpreted contextually.
The review identified several significant gaps in research. Although a majority of the studies acknowledge the complexity of
the pathways between climate/weather and undernutrition as
mediated by several confounders, none attempts a comprehensive assessment, most probably because of the unavailability of
reliable, concurrent data on the entire/exhaustive range of factors (environmental, agricultural, health, demographic, and socioeconomic) that would allow adjusting for confounders.
Only three studies investigated micronutrient deficiencies, even
though climate change also will affect the nutrient content of food
grains. In addition, few studies investigate urban food security with
respect to climate change. Urban poor are net food buyers, and
therefore affordability and access become the main concerns (59).
These factors are governed by global factors such as production,
distribution, storage, and consumption in addition to pricing
strategies. Steep social gradients in urban areas create a different
level of complexity. To capture the complete spectrum of the
impacts of climate change on childhood undernutrition, both
these areas require further research.
The review confirms that effective adaptation will require
systematic assimilation of strong underpinning evidence at a
household level but generated globally over time and focused
particularly on the least adapted and most vulnerable small-scale
subsistence farmers. We recommend that future assessments
should address a range of factors such as rainfall (amount, seasonality, and variance), temperature, extreme weather events,
and elevation/altitude. Preferably, the investigations should account for all nutritional parameters (including micronutrient
deficiencies), given that the mortality risk is increased more than
ninefold in severely underweight or wasted children and in those
stunted (1). Multicenter studies covering geographically distinct
areas, although resource intensive, would be ideal. Alternately,
uniformly designed individual studies that maintain a focus at the
micro level but allow meta-analysis could prove useful also.
Long-term, high-quality data from health and demographic surveillance systems, high-resolution spatial data systems, and environmental monitoring systems will allow us to establish and validate
the links and will help quantify effectively the impacts of climate
change on childhood nutrition. These data are indispensable for
effective early warning systems and future predictions at the
household levels but currently are unavailable at a majority of the
locations. Meanwhile, where available, data should be assimilated
from individual systems for sufficient time spans (a minimum of
10 y). Additionally, it may become necessary to implement
novel applications of existing statistical approaches and to develop new ones. Existing Health and Demographic Surveillance
Systems such as those within the INDEPTH Network (www.
indepth-network.org/) (60) offer a reliable starting point for
investigations of this complex nature and should be explored.

lection bias. Because of the lack of clarity in the studies’ definitions of climate and weather variability/change, some of the
impacts may remain under- or overreported. Caution is needed
in interpreting these results, because the studies included predominantly secondary data from national surveys collected for
other objectives. We excluded studies with an exclusive focus on
micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., anemia) and acute undernutrition
(wasting or underweight), because these parameters show a
stronger seasonal component. We also did not include studies
investigating the impacts of climate change on undernutrition
among the urban poor (net buyers). This exclusion may have led
to a selection bias and therefore an underestimation of the overall
climate-related impact on childhood undernutrition. We included
documents from both peer-reviewed and gray literature, and the
overall conclusions from the review suggest similar findings across
the identified studies. Therefore, we believe the review is valuable
in corroborating preliminary evidence.
Conclusions
Assessing the pathways through which climate change impacts
undernutrition is, without doubt, a complex and daunting challenge but is one that must be addressed. The impact of climate/
weather variability on crop yields has been documented and
widely acknowledged, as have the direct impacts of crop yields on
childhood undernutrition, especially acute undernutrition. Current evidence, although limited, does suggest a strong link between weather variables and childhood stunting. However, very
few studies based on primary data investigate the proportion of
the total number of stunted children that can be attributed to
climate/weather variability. Further, few studies attempt to investigate the proportion of morbidity and mortality in children
under age 5 y that is directly or indirectly attributable to undernutrition at a household level, probably because of the complexities of sociodemographic and economic factors and, more
importantly, because long-term, reliable data are not available.
The main challenge to date remains establishing the causality of
an association. Existing methods for analysis may require reviewing. Although both the WHO and the IPCC report malnutrition as
the most significant impact of climate change on health, current
evidence in the field is inconsistent, addresses a limited set of
variables, and therefore is inadequate.
In the presence of limited comprehensive empirical evidence at
the household level, current adaptation strategies lack the necessary
precision. Understanding and quantifying associations between climate variability, crop yields, and childhood undernutrition, ideally
at both the macro and the micro levels, is necessary. Documenting
these associations systematically over the next years, even “with
associated uncertainties,” may help generate more realistic estimates for the future and therefore should be done.

Limitations of the Study. The inclusion of only documents in the
English language in the review may have led to a degree of se-
