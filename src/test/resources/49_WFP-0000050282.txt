Key Findings

1



Overall, South Sudanese households are facing the worst food security situation since the
Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) began in 2010.



More than three-fourths (76 percent) of the households across the country are facing
moderate to severe food insecurity. This is higher than the 67 percent reported from the
FSNMS survey conducted in December 2016 and also the 71 percent during the lean
season (June) of 2016. 80 percent of the households recorded below acceptable food
consumption scores, of which 54 percent had poor consumption and 26 percent had
borderline consumption. Considering the household hunger scale, 79 percent of the
households experienced moderate to severe hunger (66 percent moderate and 13
percent severe) up from 68 percent (65 percent moderate and 3 percent severe) at the
same time one year ago.



Food insecurity has spread out of traditional areas of Great Upper Nile region. High food
insecurity levels are also observed in the Equatorias region, once considered the bread
basket of the country, with a significant deterioration from the same period in the last
year, an indication of the impact of prevailing insecurity in this region, and consequent
disruption of livelihoods.



Overall, households are spending almost two thirds (64 percent) of their monthly
expenditures on food, higher than the same period last year (57 percent), showing a
decrease in their purchasing power and their ability to procure essential non-food items
and services.



Households have been facing challenges in sustaining income through their livelihoods.
Some 90 percent of the respondents reported their income had either reduced or
remained the same compared to one year ago. This has an adverse impact on household
purchasing power and consequent food security at a time when food prices have
continued to rise exorbitantly. The retail prices of sorghum and field beans in Juba in
September 2017 were higher by 235 percent and 290 percent respectively, compared to
one year ago.



Overall, high food prices is the number one shock reported by most households,
followed by insecurity and lack of access, drought or dry spell, loss of employment
based income and human illness. Households reporting high food prices as the main
shock were most common in Warrap (79 percent) and Eastern Equatoria (71 percent),
while those with insecurity as the main shock were found more in Upper Nile (57
percent), Lakes, and Eastern Equatoria (55 percent each).



Overall, 93 percent of households are found to be adopting at least one food based
coping strategy in the one week period prior to the survey. Overall, 73 percent of
households were resorting to livelihood based coping strategies. Among them, 41
percent had to resort to emergency coping strategies while 21 percent were resorting
to crisis coping strategies and 11 percent were practicing stress coping strategies.



Overall, global acute malnutrition (GAMis at 19.1 percent, higher than 17.9 percent
during the same time last year. A deterioration in GAM was observed in six former
states, the exceptions were Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Western Bahr el Ghazal,
and Unity.



Humanitarian assistance has a very positive impact on food consumption at household
level. Overall, 38 percent of households reported receiving some form of humanitarian
assistance. Among them, the main forms of assistance were food (71 percent),
agriculture inputs (13 percent), and health or medicines (15 percent). Households
receiving humanitarian assistance had significantly better food consumption levels
compared to those not receiving.



Among those receiving food assistance, almost 90 percent of households reported that
food assistance was collected by some female member of the household.

Food insecurity in August 2017 compared to June 2016

50%

Compared to the same time last
year, populations facing severe
food insecurity have increased
from 21 percent to 26 percent,
while those facing moderate
food insecurity slightly increased
from 49 percent to 50 percent.

Moderately food insecure

Aug-17

The level of food insecurity has
increased
in
most
areas
compared to the same period
last year. The most significant
increases were observed in the
greater
Equatorias
region,
previously known as the bread
basket of the country. For
example, the percentage of food
insecure population increased
from 60 percent to 83 percent in
Western Equatoria, 53 percent to
76 percent in Eastern Equatoria,
and 58 percent to 79 percent in
Central Equatoria. Similarly, the
situation has also deteriorated in
Jonglei (57 percent to 73
percent), Lakes (75 percent to 86
percent) and Western Bahr el
Ghazal (81 percent to 87
percent). Some improvement
was observed in Greater Upper
Nile where food insecurity

21%

This is the highest level of food
insecurity observed in South
Sudan since the FSNMS began
monitoring the food security
situation in 2010. This is higher
than what was observed in the
last round in December 2016
(right after the main harvest
season),
when
the
food
insecurity prevalence was 67
percent and also higher than the
results
of FSNMS survey
conducted in June 2016 (70
percent), the peak of the lean
season in that year.

49%

Compared to the post-harvest
season (December 2016), the
severe food insecurity has
increased from 15 percent to 26
percent, while the moderately
food insecure population has
remained around the same (52
percent in December 2016, 51
percent in August 2017).

Jun-16

Using the CARI (Consolidated
Approach to Reporting Indicators
of Food Security) methodology,
76 percent of households were
found to be food insecure in
August 2017; among those 50
percent were moderately food
insecure and 26 percent were
severely food insecure.

South Sudan Food insecurity trends

Lakes

Food insecurity and malnutrition situation August 2017
reached famine level in some counties
in early 2017 with substantial
improvement in Unity (75 percent to
65 percent), Northern Bahr el Ghazal
(86 percent to 77 percent) and Upper
Nile (80 percent to 68 percent) as
compared to June 20161 . Significant
improvement was also observed in
and Warrap (85 percent to 70
percent).
The very high level of food insecurity
in the greater Equatoria region –where
a high proportion of the total
population
is
concentrated–
contributed significantly to the overall
magnitude of food insecurity in the
country.
Prevailing insecurity, the protracted
economic crisis characterized by
hyperinflation and depreciation of the
South Sudanese pound (SSP), soaring
food prices, a high cereal crop deficit
and drought in part of the country
have contributed to this high level of
food insecurity.
This increasing trend of food insecurity
has now reached an unprecedented
level, with three out of every four
households being food insecure, and
has become a matter of serious
humanitarian concern in the country.

The map shows the geographic distribution of food insecurity based on CARI methodology. Counties have been classified based on
the percentage of households with moderate to severe food insecurity. It includes the pie charts with summary on proportion of
households under different levels of food insecurity in each state, and also shows the GAM rates for each state (the details of the
GAM are provided in the nutrition section).
Statistics on key food security indicators by county and nutrition indicators by state are provided in the annex.

1 While

the food assistance has been significant across the country, it is likely that the improved food security situation in Unity and Northern Bahr el Ghazal is mainly due to the humanitarian
food assistance.

2. Food consumption
The food consumption situation is very precarious in South Sudan with
a further decline in acceptable consumption compared to the same
period last year.
Overall, only one fifth (20 percent) of the households were found to be
having acceptable food consumption, while the majority (54 percent)
were experiencing poor consumption and 26 percent were in the
borderline consumption group.
Compared to the same period last year, the proportion of households
with poor consumption has increased from 49 percent to 54 percent,
while those with acceptable consumption declined from 22 percent to
20 percent. There was a slight decrease in households with borderline
consumption from 29 percent to 26 percent, explained by the increase
of the poor food consumption group.

Food Consumption Groups

Looking at the sub-national level, the food consumption situation has worsened in most areas, compared to the same period last year. All states have shown
an increase in proportion of population with poor food consumption group, except Warrap, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Unity.
In the Greater Equatorias, the economic crisis resulted in reduced income opportunities, and insecurity caused massive displacement, that led to lower
overall production. These factors contributed to the worrisome food security situation. For instance, the proportion of households with poor consumption
has increased from 43 percent to 67 percent in Western Equatoria, from 41 percent to 64 percent in Central Equatoria and 34 percent to 49 percent in
Eastern Equatoria. Other notable increases were observed in Western Bahr el Ghazal (52 percent to 74 percent), Lakes (58 percent to 75 percent) and
Jonglei (38 percent to 43 percent).
On average, adult members of the households were eating only 1.3 meals per day, while the children (6 to 12 years old) were eating 1.4 meals per day,
compared to 1.7 and 2.0 meals per day respectively during the same time last year.

As per the household hunger scale, which indicates household food deprivation, 79 percent of households faced moderate (66 percent) to severe hunger (13
percent), significantly higher than the same time last year when 68 percent faced moderate (65 percent) to severe (3 percent) hunger; the increase in the
severe hunger proportion has been significant.

3. Sources of food
Overall, almost half (48 percent) of the
households across South Sudan reported
the market as their main source of
cereals and tubers consumed in the one
week period prior to the survey. 29
percent of households reported own
production as the main source of the
cereals and tubers consumed while 15
percent reported food assistance as the
main source.
The proportion of households who
reported market as the main source of
cereals and tubers was highest in
Northern Bahr el Ghazal at 76 percent
followed by Lakes and Upper Nile (62
percent each), while it was lowest in
Western Equatoria (15 percent) followed
by Unity (30 percent). The proportion of
households reporting own production as
the main source of cereals and tubers
was highest in Western Equatoria (81
percent) followed by Central Equatoria
(44 percent), while it was the lowest in
Upper Nile (16 percent) followed by
Northern Bahr el Ghazal (18 percent) and
Western Bahr el Ghazal (19 percent).
Food assistance was reported as the
main source of food consumed in Unity
with 40 percent of the households
reporting it as the main source, followed
by Jonglei (36 percent). A significant
proportion of households also reported
food assistance as the main source in
Eastern Equatoria (19 percent) and
Upper Nile (10 percent).

Overall, 65 percent of milk and dairy
products, 62 percent of vegetables and
leaves, 28 percent of legumes and nuts,
11 percent of oils and fats, 25 percent of South Sudan
Unity
meat, and 32 percent of fruits were from
CEQ
own production.
In the case of vegetables and leaves, in
addition to own production (62 percent)
and markets (11 percent), there is also
significant proportion attained through
gathering (23 percent). This proportion
was also significant for fruits at 15
percent.

In the case of meat, in addition to markets (50 percent) and own
production (25 percent), hunting is the main source employed by
8 percent of households; while own fishing was the
source of fish consumed by 25 percent of households.
The dependence on markets versus own production, showed a
seasonal pattern seen similar to that observed over the years.
Households dependent on markets for their food needs have
been very vulnerable due to soaring food prices and lack of cash
income, and in many cases poor availability of food in the
nearest markets.

4. Household profile
Overall, 51.4 percent of the heads of
households were males, while the rest
were females. Unity had the highest
proportion
of
female
headed
households (82 percent), followed by
Northern Bahr el Ghazal (63 percent);
while this proportion was lowest in
Lakes (17 percent), and followed by
Western Equatoria (23 percent). This
proportion is between 39 and 60
percent in other states.
Overall, 9 percent of households
surveyed
were
displaced.
This
proportion was highest in Western
Bahr el Ghazal at 35 percent, followed
by Upper Nile (22 percent), Jonglei (14
percent), Central Equatoria (13
percent) and Unity (12 percent). In
Wau county of Western Bahr el Ghazal,
nearly the entire population (96
percent) live as IDPs. Other counties
with significant proportion of displaced
households include Longochuk (53.8
percent), Leer and Khorfulus (48.9
percent each), Maban (46.4 percent),
Ayod (43.1 percent) and Nasir (41
percent).
Some 12 percent of the households had
at least one disabled member in the
family and 12 percent had at least one
chronically ill member. Among the
former states, Unity had the highest

proportion (20 percent) of the
households with at least one
handicapped member, followed by
Jonglei (14 percent). Western Bahr el
Ghazal, Lakes and Northern Bahr el
Ghazal had a relatively low proportion
(7 to 9 percent), while others had
between 10 and 13 percent. At county
level, Mayendit in Unity had the largest
proportion (44 percent) of households
with at least one disabled member.
Other counties with very high
proportion are Leer (32 percent) and
Panyijar (27 percent) in Unity;
Khorflus/Canal Pigi (33 percent) in
Jonglei; Ulang (28 percent) in Upper
Nile; and Ezo (26 percent) in Western
Equatoria. Similarly, Upper Nile had the
highest proportion (19 percent) of the
households with at least one
chronically ill member, followed by
Unity (17 percent) and Central
Equatoria (15 percent). Northern Bahr
el Ghazal, Lakes and Western Bahr el
Ghazal had relatively lower proportion
(6 to 7 percent), while this value was
between 8 and 14 percent in other
states.
Among the counties, Mayendit (68
percent), Fashoda (63 percent), Leer
(61 percent), Old Fangak (60 percent),
Malakal (58 percent), Pibor (57
percent), Ulang (54 percent), Pibor (54
percent) and Kajokeji (53 percent) had
the highest proportion of households
with at least one disabled member.

Some 20 percent of households reported at least one member of the
household migrated out of their normal place of residence in the past one
year. Among the households who reported migration, 37 percent reported
migrating to neighboring countries while 8 percent migrated to nonneighboring countries. Unity had the highest proportion (38 percent) of
households reporting migration, followed by Upper Nile (37 percent),
Central Equatoria (32 percent) and Jonglei (30 percent). This proportion was
relatively low in Lakes (4 percent), Western Equatoria (6 percent) and
Western Bahr el Ghazal (9 percent). Other states had this proportion
between 10 to 20 percent.Lack of food and insecurity were the two most
important reasons for migration, as reported by the households.

5. Livelihoods and income
Livelihood types
Overall, some 53 percent of households reported agriculture as the
primary source of income, followed by livestock (8 percent),
gathering/hunting (8 percent), casual labour (7 percent), and food
assistance (6 percent). These vary largely depending on the various
geographic areas and livelihood zones. Other sources of livelihood
include petty trade including sale of alcohol (6 percent), sale of
firewood/charcoal/grasses (6 percent), and skilled labour and
salaried work (2 percent). Western Equatoria had the highest
proportion of households (90 percent) with agriculture as the main
livelihood, followed by Lakes (77 percent) and Warrap (65 percent).
This proportion was lowest in Jonglei (28 percent), followed by
Upper Nile (34 percent) and Eastern Equatoria (37 percent). On the
other hand, Upper Nile and Eastern Equatoria had the highest
proportion (14 percent each) of households with livestock as main
livelihood, followed by Jonglei (13 percent) and Unity (12 percent).
Reliance on casual wage labour was most significant in Central
Equatoria (19 percent), while reliance on food assistance was most
significant in Jonglei (20 percent) followed by Unity (12 percent).
The economic crisis and conflict have adversely affected the
livelihoods of most households. Many households reported reduced
income through their livelihood, while a significant proportion (23
percent) reported that they had to switch income generative
activities in the last one year. The proportion reporting such a change
was highest in Unity (41 percent) followed by Jonglei (35 percent)
while it was lowest in Northern Bahr el Ghazal (11 percent) followed
by Lakes (15 percent).

cited partial loss of the income source. About a quarter (26 percent) cited
changed market conditions as the reason while 10 percent thought it was
the reduced value of money due to inflation.

6. Expenditure
Half of the households were found to have high to very high share2 of
expenditure on food, which is a clear indication of their vulnerability
and inability to purchase basic non-food items and services. These
included 38 percent who had very high share of expenditure on food
and 12 percent who had high food expenditure share. These figures are
higher than the survey conducted in December (32 percent very high
and 9 percent high), while comparable to the lean season of 2016 (11
percent and 41 percent respectively). The high prevalence of very high
levels of food expenditures was mainly observed in Northern Bahr el
Ghazal and Warrap, which are on one side traditionally highly
dependent on markets, but are also among the most stable areas in the
country where markets are still functioning.
Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of the monthly expenditure of an
average household in South Sudan was on food; this proportion was
highest in Northern Bahr el Ghazal (75 percent), followed by Warrap
(74 percent), while it was lowest in Western Equatoria (53 percent).
Relatively low share of monthly expenditure on food in Unity (55
percent) did not signify the availability of own stock but rather an
indication of the significant disruption of markets and reduced cash
economy especially in Southern Unity

7. Agriculture
Access to agricultural land is not a
major concern for rural households in
South Sudan: about 85 percent of the
respondents reported having access to
land for cultivation, and among them
90 percent reportedly planted crops or
planned to plant in the 2017 season.
Eastern and Western Equatorias had
the highest proportion (94 percent
each)
of
households
owning
agricultural land followed by Warrap
and Northern Bahr el Ghazal (91
percent each), while Upper Nile had
the lowest (60 percent), followed by
Jonglei (77 percent) and Unity (78
percent). Most are subsistence
farmers, with 60 percent of
households reportedly owning one
fedan3 or less.
About half (48 percent) of farmers
relied on their own stock while others
(31 percent) purchased seeds. Other
sources include FAO (8 percent), NGOs
(6 percent), gifts (6 percent) and
others (1 percent).
Agricultural production is very poor. As
reported by the households, an
average farming household in South
Sudan currently can produce food
sufficient for their own consumption
needs for only 3.2 months of the year.

13

3

This self-sufficiency is highest in
Western Equatoria at 5.8 months,
while is lowest in Central Equatoria at
1.6 months.
When asked “what you intend to do
with the expected production?”, three
quarters of the respondents said that
they would use it for own
consumption, 21 percent said they
would consume and sell, 2 percent
indicated they would consume and
give out, and the remaining 2 percent
indicated they would consume, sell
and give out. It shows that even with
farmers who do not produce enough
for themselves for the whole year, still
some of them sell part of their
produce to be able to cover other
needs. The only exception to this trend
was seen in Western Equatoria, where
the vast majority (63 percent) of
households reported their intention to
consume and sell part of their
produce, most probably to meet other
basic needs.
As for the main challenges during
farming, shortage of rain was reported
as the main challenge by 42 percent of
households, followed by pests and
diseases (17 percent), shortage of
seeds (11 percent), and insecurity (9
percent).

Lakes had the largest proportion (62 percent) of households reporting
shortage of rains as the main challenge, followed by Eastern Equatoria,
Warrap and Unity (50 percent each) and 42 percent in Jonglei. Central and
Eastern Equatoria has 22 to 25 percent while other former states had this
proportion between 35 to 37 percent. Greater Equatoria (Western
Equatoria: 26 percent), Eastern Equatoria: 22 percent and Central
Equatoria 21 percent) had relatively high proportions of households
reporting crop pest and disease as the main challenge, followed by Upper
Nile (23 percent) and Western Bahr el Ghazal (21 percent). Shortage of
seeds was most prominent in Upper Nile (25 percent), while insecurity
was most reported in Central and Eastern Equatoria (21 percent each) as
the main challenge.

8. Livestock
Livestock is an important contributor to household food security in rural areas of
South Sudan. A significant reduction in livestock ownership has been noted. Overall,
46 percent of households owned at least one livestock herd or farm animal during
this survey, while 57 percent of the households were reported owning livestock
during the same time last year.

During the time of this survey (July-August 2017), the proportion of households
owning livestock was highest in Lakes (69 percent), followed by Warrap (57
percent), and was lowest in Central Equatoria (22 percent) followed by Western
Bahr el Ghazal (24 percent). As for Central Equatoria, this represents a very sharp
decrease, as over 60 percent of households reported owning livestock in June 2016.
In this area, the main challenges experienced by livestock keepers are lack of
veterinary services, as well as insecurity, which is considered as the main problem
by one out of five livestock keepers.
Among those raring livestock, an average household in South Sudan owns six cattle,
two sheep, four goats and two poultry. In terms of Tropical Livestock Unit4 , an
average livestock raring household would own 5.1 TLU of livestock. Eastern
Equatoria was found to have the highest livestock ownership at 15 TLU, followed by
Warrap at 7.4, while it was lowest in Western Equatoria (0.4), followed by Central
Equatoria (0.7), where livestock keepers traditionally own smaller herds.
Significant concern on livestock health was noted, coupled with a significant lack of
veterinary services, which is the main livestock-related concern for 27 percent of
households. Overall, 30 percent of the owners reported having their livestock in
good condition, 43 percent in moderate condition and others were either in
borderline or thin with ribs or bones visible. Some 44 percent reported that this is
not normal during this time of the year. The body condition was of particular
concern in Jonglei, where only 9 percent had good smooth appearance and 53
percent were in moderate condition. This was followed by Eastern Equatoria, where
only 15 percent had good smooth appearance and 47 percent with moderate
condition, and 62 percent of respondents said that it is not normal at this time of

Pest and diseases and insecurity were also reported as the
main constraints in livestock production, for 36 percent and 9
percent of households. Responsdents reporting lack of water
as the main constraint were highest (40 percent) in Eastern
Equatoria. Only in Western Bahr el Ghazal, a significant
proportion of households (20 percent) stated experiencing no
major constraint in relation to livestock keeping.

9. Markets and household food access
Markets as the main source of household food
Markets are the main sources of food consumed by the households, particularly during the lean
consumed
season, when own stocks are at their lowest even for farming households. The market is the main
source of cereals and tubers consumed for 48 percent of households; sugar, sweet and honey for
88 percent; oil, fat and butter for 58 percent; legumes, nuts for 47 percent; fruits for 45 percent;
Sugar, sweet, honey
88%
milk and dairy for 21 percent; and vegetables for 11 percent.
Oil, fat, butter
58%
After sugar, oil and fats scored the highest proportion of purchase through markets (58 percent,
nationally); relatively lower proportions observed in Unity and Jonglei (42 and 46 percent
Meat, fish, eggs
57%
respectively), could be due to large share of the population receiving oil through food assistance
(54 percent in Unity and 37 percent in Jonglei)
Cereals
48%
The proportion of households who reported market as the main source of cereals and tubers was
highest in Northern Bahr el Ghazal at 76 percent followed by Lakes and Upper Nile (at 62 percent
Fruits

each), while it was lowest in Western Equatoria (15 percent) followed by Unity (30 percent),
especially in Leer county (4 percent), where most markets have been heavily disrupted by the Legumes, nuts and beans

conflict.
Milk, dairy
24%
There are considerable problems in availability of food in the market, and beyond physical access
there are also economic access constraints. Only 38 percent of the households said cereals are

always available in their markets and 14 percent reported these are often available. On the other
hand, 34 percent said cereals are available only sometime and 14 percent reported they are not
available at all.
The peak of the lean season (June-July) is also associated with the lowest seasonal availability of

foods, with 58 percent of households reporting reduced availability of food in the market in July
and 55 percent in June. This has had a serious and adverse impact on the household food security.
58%
55%
About 45 percent of households reported distance to the market as the first main constraint for
market access, followed by high transportation cost (31 percent), and insecurity or conflict (27

However, economic access is by far the number one concern for a vast majority of the households

said that they did not have sufficient resources to buy food from the market even when the food
was available.
In order to cope with the low purchasing power, many households, resorted to stopping or

reducing the quantity of rice purchased (30%), , stopping or reducing buying meat (17 percent),
sorghum grain (12 percent), maize (11 percent), wheat flour (17 percent), and vegetable oil (16
percent). Half of the respondents (51 percent) said that they have resorted in substituting meat
and rice, high value commodities, with sorghum grains, maize grains or flour (19 percent).

10. Macroeconomic crisis driving food insecurity
The ongoing macro-economic crisis, which has been further worsened by the conflict and insecurity,
has contributed to food insecurity levels that have steadily increased over all seasons since 2014
reaching the highest peak ever during the lean period in 2017.
The inflation rate in South Sudan measured through the Consumer Price Index data released by the
National Bureau of Statistics, has declined significantly in the past one year after the peak level of
836 percent in October 2016. Despite this decline, inflation rates still remain very high and the
annual inflation in August 2017 was 165 percent as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. This
hyperinflation is attributed to fuel prices that increased by more than 100 percent in most areas; fuel
shortages; ever increasing food prices rising at a faster pace than the wage rates, with cereal prices
increasing in August 2017 by over 100 percent in most markets on a year to year basis; the continued
depreciation of the South Sudanese Pound (SSP), with the parallel market exchange rate falling from
SSP 58/US$ in August 2016 to SSP 165/US$ in August 2017 (representing a 65 percent loss in value
over one year), and shortage of foreign currency which had negatively affected the food imports and
supply situation.

Trends of white sorghum price in Juba,
(SSP/malua)

As the country is dependent on import for staple foods, the prices of food commodities are driven
mainly by the deprecation of the local currency, high transport costs, high fuel prices, sporadic
disruptions to the supply system and disrupted agricultural activities in the Equatoria states, the
traditional food basket of the country. The prices of staple cereal, sorghum, stood much higher
compared to the five-year average and the same months last year across the markets in South
Sudan. Similarly, field beans, one of the protein sources, have witnessed significant price increases
across markets. The capital market, Juba, which serves as the proxy to prices of staples in other Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

locations, saw an increase in retail price of sorghum and field bean by 235 percent and 290 percent
respectively, September 2017 compared to the same time in the previous year.

11. Assistance received
Some 38 percent of households reported
receiving humanitarian assistance in the past
three months prior to the survey, which is
the highest ever proportion of humanitarian
assistance recorded by FSNMS. This
proportion is much higher than the 22
percent during the lean season of 2016, and
also higher than 35 percent reported in
December 2016. Jonglei had the highest
proportion (71 percent) of the respondent
households who received assistance,
followed by Eastern Equatoria (60 percent)
and Unity (53 percent). On the other hand,
Western Equatoria had the lowest
proportion (9 percent), followed by Lakes (15
percent) and Western Bahr el Ghazal5 (15
percent).

followed by Eastern Equatoria (78 percent)
and Northern Bahr el Ghazal (77 percent).
Central Equatoria had highest proportion of
households receiving agricultural support (44
percent receiving agricultural inputs and 41 South Sudan
percent receiving tools) and also fishing gear
(12 percent).

Significant increase in the coverage of
humanitarian aid can be seen in Jonglei,
Unity and Eastern Equatoria.

NBeG

Among those who received assistance, some
71 percent benefited from general food
distribution (GFD), 6 percent from food for
assets; additionally people benefited from
school meals (2 percent), nutrition support
(10 percent), health amenities (15 percent),
and agricultural inputs such as seeds (13
percent) and agricultural tools (8 percent).
Among those who received assistance, Unity
(90 percent) and Jonglei (80 percent) had the
highest proportion reportedly receiving GFD,

Among the households who received food
assistance, some 13 percent reported
receiving food within the last one week prior
to survey, 31 percent received 2-3 weeks
ago, 34 percent received it 3-4 weeks ago,
while the remaining 22 percent had received
it more than a month ago. On average, a
household received 50 kgs of cereals, 9 kgs of
pulses and 5 litres of cooking oil in the last
distribution cycle. More than half (53
percent) indicated they shared their food
assistance with relatives and neighbors.
Clearly, humanitarian assistance, particularly
the food assistance, has been very important
in stabilizing the food security situation, and
thus its continuity is very important.
Particularly, the increased humanitarian
assistance in Unity and Jonglei was a direct
response to the dire food security situation in
these areas as presented in the IPC analysis
of February 2017 and the update in June
2017. The IPC analysis released in February
stated that from February to July 2017, Leer
and Mayendit were classified in Famine,

the humanitarian assistance was delivered as planned’ from February to July
2017. Thanks to massive multi-sectoral humanitarian response, no county was
classified in Phase 5 when the IPC update was conducted in May. The IPC update
released in June noted that the early detection of the Famine followed by the
subsequent large-scale and immediate response averted further loss of life, thus
underscoring the importance of evidence based analysis and response.
Overall, households receiving humanitarian assistance were found to be better
off in terms of food consumption than those who did not receive assistance.
Households receiving humanitarian assistance are less likely (46.9% as compared
to 57.5%) to have a poor food consumption and more likely (25 percent
compared to 18 percent) to have acceptable food consumption

The analysis revealed that it was mostly the females who went to receive food from the
distribution point - 86 percent of household reported food collected by female less than 60
years of age, while 3 percent had it collected by females older than 60. Males less than 60
years of age collected food in 9 percent of cases, while males older than 60 collected food in 1
percent of households.

Some 69 percent of respondents indicated that in the past three months, it was mainly the
woman in the household who made decision on the utilization of the food received; while it
was decided by men in 15 percent cases and by both in 16 percent. Western Bahr el Ghazal
had the lowest proportion (38 percent) of households with women deciding on the utilization
of the food, followed by Upper Nile (44 percent), while this proportion was highest in Central

High food prices (reported by 57 percent) and
insecurity and violence (36 percent) were the
most prominent household level shocks in the
past six months prior to the survey. This was
followed by: drought, dry spell or irregular rains
(30 percent), reduced income (22 percent) or
loss of employment (6 percent), illness (17
percent) and epidemics (5 percent), crop pests
and diseases (14 percent), high fuel/transport
costs and other non-food prices (14 percent) and
death of a working household member (9
percent). Some geographic variation was noted
in the household shocks. Households reporting
high food prices as the main shock were most
prevalent in Warrap (79 percent) and Eastern
Equatoria (71 percent) while those with
insecurity as the main shock were most in Upper
Nile (57 percent), Lakes, and Eastern Equatoria
(55 percent each). The proportion of households
reporting drought or dry spell as a shock was
highest in Lakes (66 percent), followed by
Eastern Equatoria (51 percent) and Warrap (42
percent). Those reporting crop pests and disease
as a shock were highest in Eastern Equatoria (22
percent), followed by Northern Bahr el Ghazal
(20 percent).
The precarious food security situation in the face
of such shocks, led households to resort to a
number of coping strategies. Some 93 percent of
households were thus found to be adopting at
least one food based coping strategy in the one
week period prior to the survey. Common
strategies included relying

on less preferred or less expensive food (87

Overall, a deterioration was observed in acute malnutrition
compared to the same period last year. The Global Acute
Malnutrition (GAM) was above the emergency threshold of 15
percent in nine out of the ten states in this assessment, while seven
states had GAM above 15 percent in the same period in 2016. The
highest GAM rate was recorded in UNITY (23.8 percent) followed by
Jonglei (22.6 percent), and Warrap (22 percent). In Central Equatoria
where the acute malnutrition was previously low (6.4 percent in
2016, 3.7 percent in 2015), the GAM was reported at 15.3 percent,
indicating a significant deterioration of the nutrition situation.
Looking at the trends in the past few years, the GAM prevalence has
deteriorated progressively in Eastern Equatoria from 11.1 percent in
2015 to 15.1 percent in 2016 and 20 percent in 2017. Similarly, in
Lakes where GAM prevalence was below the emergency level in
previous rounds of the FSNMS, the prevalence increased significantly
reaching 21.7 percent in 2017. The situation in greater Upper Nile
and Warrap has persisted above the emergency threshold. The
exception was Northern Bahr el Ghazal, where the GAM prevalence
has reduced by nearly half, from 33.3 percent in 2016 to 17.7
percent in 2017.

complementary feeding practices such as minimum dietary diversity,
minimum meal frequency, and minimum acceptable diet among children
aged 6 to 23.9 months. The caregivers were asked what the children
received in the 24-hour preceding the survey. A total of 2,596 children
age 6 to 23 months were assessed, out of which the analysis was done on
2511. Findings of dietary diversity, meal frequency, and minimum
acceptable diet is shown in the Figure.
The recommended complementary feeding practice in South Sudan is
generally underutilized. The prevalence of minimum dietary diversity
(MDD) is very low, only 5.3 percent of infants and young children 6-23
months of age had received four or more food groups. As shown in the
Figure, the lowest prevalence was recorded in Lakes, Northern Bahr el
Ghazal, and Central Equatoria. Dietary diversity is defined as the number
of different foods or food groups consumed over a given period. The
minimum dietary diversity means the consumption of at least four out of
seven food groups7.

Moreover, the composite indicator of quality and quantity of
complimentary feeds called Minimum Acceptable Diet (MAD) shows a
disturbing situation with 1.6 percent (lowest in Lakes 0.0 percent and
highest 4.5 percent in Unity). MAD is composed of Minimum Dietary
Diversity and Minimum Meal Frequency. It captures the proportion of
children 6–23 months of age who receive a mini¬mum acceptable diet
(apart from breast milk).

Similarly, the average meal frequency is very poor. About 18 percent of
children received solid, semi-solid or soft foods, the minimum number of
times or more during the previous day of the survey. The prevalence
across the former states is similar with MDD that show low rate in Lakes,
Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Central Equatoria. Meal frequency is
considered a proxy for energy intake from foods other than breast milk.

iii. Maternal nutrition
the highest prevalence of wasted women coincide
with those with the highest levels of acute
malnutrition among children 6 to 59 months,
including; Jonglei (43.2 percent), Lakes (36.8
percent), and Warrap (36.74 percent).
Wasting was 28.9 percent among the pregnant
and lactating women and does not differ
significantly from wasting among the nonpregnant non-lactating women (28.3 percent).

A total of 3474 women of 15 to 49 years old were
measured using Mid-Upper Arm Circumference
(MUAC). Wasting based on MUAC (<230cm) was
prevalent in 28.5 percent of the women. As shown
below in Figure 3, compared to the same season in
the previous years, the trend of wasting in most
part of the States is deteriorating. The States with

could be one among many reasons for the
elevated prevalence of diarrhea. The statistical
analysis shows that their illness was strongly
associated with acute malnutrition. Therefore,
strengthening disease prevention measures may
contribute to improvement of the nutrition
situation in South Sudan.

A total of 8411 children 6 to 59 months age were
assessed. The result shows that about 53 percent
of children reportedly suffered from one or more
illness in the two weeks prior to the assessment.
Majority of them had diarrhea (73 percent)
followed by fever (33 percent). The prevalence of
diarrhea is consistently high in all of the ten
former states. The assessment was conducted
during the rainy season and thus seasonal factor

15. Outlook
The results presented above from the analysis of data from FSNMS
indicate a very critical humanitarian situation in South Sudan in terms of
food security and nutrition. Some seasonal improvement is expected in
the harvest season. However, the overall food security and nutrition
situation is likely to continue to be very serious due to the following
reasons:

27



Considering the recent trends and the impact of continued conflict in
Equatoria and effect of the Fall Army Worm in some areas, the
agricultural production is likely to remain poor



There is no sign of improvement in the macroeconomic situation. The
depreciation of the South Sudanese pound, hyperinflation and the
trend of soaring food prices is likely to continue while there is no
likelihood of commensurate increase in household income.



Conflict and insecurity continue to affect many parts of the country,
disrupting livelihoods, markets and mobility, and there is no sign of any
improvement in this situation.



Humanitarian access for supporting vulnerable populations remains a
challenge particularly in areas where people are most in need.

16. Methodological Note
The twentieth round of the FSNMS survey conducted in July-August 2017.
It involved survey of households across the country with a sampling plan
provided by the National Bureau of Statistics in order to obtain
statistically representative results on food security by each county. While
the previous rounds of FSNMS provided only state wide results, sampling
plan was revised in FSNMS 20 in order to provide county wise results
needed for IPC analysis. The sampling size was designed by considering
95 percent confidence interval, a margin of error of 10 percent,
percentage of population in phase 3 and above as the prevalence rate of
food insecurity, and a minimum sample size requirement of 75
households per county. Further, by having 12 households per
enumeration area, final sampling plan was made with 84 to 108
households per county. This plan however was not deemed sufficient for
county wise results for nutrition, due to different sampling requirements
for nutrition indicators. Thus for nutrition, the results would be
representative only at the state level. In Western Bahr el Ghazal, where
there are only 3 counties, it was planned to have 144 households per
county in order to have the minimum number of children to be assessed
to get nutrition results representative at the state level. In Wuror county
in Jonglei, where nutrition results were desired at county level due to lack
of SMART surveys or other sources of nutrition data, a total of 450
households were allocated for the survey. Thus the total sample size
consisted of a total of 7,614 households, among which 7,097 households
were actually interviewed.
The distribution of household samples by different counties is provided in
the annex.
The survey instrument consisted of food security as well as nutrition
module including anthropometry of children under five. Thus this was
considered in the sampling. Training of enumerators was provided in 27
locations across the country. The trainings were provided by WFP, FAO
and UNICEF.

Electronic tablets were used for data collection in the field and
uploading into the server. In areas where it was not possible to use
tablets for security reasons, the survey was conducted in a hard
copy questionnaire and the data entered through the tablet later
on.
There were considerable constraints in field survey, in various areas
due to prevailing insecurity. Partner organizations from the food
security and livelihood cluster provided enumerators, and this was
particularly valuable in covering some of the areas which were
otherwise difficult to access.
Despite efforts, it was not possible to conduct the survey in
Morobo (Central Equatoria) and Maiwut (Upper Nile). Furthermore,
due to the same reason, the number of households which could be
surveyed in some counties were considerably less than the
sampling plan. These included Mayendit (only 25 households
surveyed) and Abiemnhom (37) in Unity; Longochuk (26) in Upper
Nile; and Kajokeji (45), Yei (48), and Terekeka (48). Hence the
results on these counties should be considered with caution.
Due to planning and logistic challenges of implementing this large
survey, the field survey for this round of FSNMS was actually
conducted during July-August, which was not precisely the height
of the lean season. In the previous years, the FSNMS survey for the
lean season was conducted in June. It implies that in the height of
the lean season, the food security and nutrition situation could
have been slightly worse than what has been captured from this
survey.
