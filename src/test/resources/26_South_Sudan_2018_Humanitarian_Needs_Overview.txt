HUMANITARIAN

NEEDS & KEY FIGURES
As the conflict in South Sudan enters its fifth year in 2018, the humanitarian
crisis has continued to intensify and expand, on a costly trajectory for the
country’s people and their outlook on the future. The compounding effects of
widespread violence and sustained economic decline have further diminished
the capacity of people to face threats to their health, safety and livelihoods.
People in need of assistance and protection number 7 million, even as more
than 2 million have fled to neighbouring countries.
HUMANITARIAN NEEDS
Ongoing fighting and surges of violence in new areas have forced people to flee their homes, many of
them multiple times. The number of people uprooted since the start of the conflict in 2013 has reached more than 4
million, including 1.9 million internally displaced people, with up to 85 per cent estimated to be children1 and women.2
More than 2 million people have departed to neighbouring countries—up 1.3 million since the renewed violence in July
2016. One million people, largely from the Equatorias, have fled southward to Uganda alone.
Violence and rights violations continue unchecked and have become a persistent reality for civilians.
Internally displaced people’s access to services has eroded with insecurity and economic decline. Rape and other types of
gender-based violence are pervasive but go largely unreported—the 1,324 cases reported in the first half of 2017 represent
just a fraction of the aggressions faced mostly by women and girls, in a situation where undertaking daily survival tasks,
such a collecting firewood and water, places them under threat.
Continued economic decline has undermined people’s access to basic resources. The cost of living has
continued to escalate markedly. The effects are particularly acute in urban areas, with inflation reaching 183 per cent in
Juba year on year.3 The South Sudanese pound (SSP) continued to depreciate to lower-than-ever values of more than 130
SSP to 1 US dollar in October 2017. Fuel shortages have constrained activity and led to theft and insecurity, while long gaps
and inconsistency in salary payments to public sector employees have impacted the provision of health-care and education
services, and the rule of law.
Hunger and malnutrition have escalated on an unrelenting course, with nearly 1.1 million children under age
5 estimated to be acutely malnourished and in need of life-saving services. Although localized famine was stopped in
2017, severe food insecurity continued to increase for the fifth consecutive year and a record-high 6 million people were
severely food insecure in September. Post-harvest gains in October-December are expected to reduce the number to 4.8
million, though pockets of populations are in humanitarian catastrophe status in Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei and Western
Bahr el Ghazal. Severe food insecurity is expected to rise again to 5.1 million people in early 2018 and deteriorate further
in the lean season, with the worst-case scenario of a return to famine in multiple locations across the country.
Conflict and economic crisis have taken a toll on health. Disease outbreaks have lasted longer than ever and
reached previously unaffected areas, weakening already vulnerable people’s ability to cope with multiple shocks. In 2017,
South Sudan has seen the longest-running cholera outbreak in its history, which began in June 2016 and is expected to
continue into 2018. Destruction of health-care facilities, attacks on health workers, and shortages of drugs and skilled
professionals mean access to health care is increasingly sparse. Preventable diseases like measles spread unchecked, and
cases of kala-azar and meningitis are on the rise. With only 22 per cent of health facilities fully operational, the absence
of services means that cases of emergency obstetric care, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and mental health issues go largely
untreated, causing increased mortality and morbidity.
Children continue to suffer the brunt of conflict and economic pressures. The situation for children has
deteriorated over 2017, with continued incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other grave violations having
directly affected about 100,000 children since the beginning of the conflict. More than 19,000 children are estimated to
have been recruited by armed actors, up from 17,000 in 2016. A total of 16,055 unaccompanied, separated or missing
children have been registered in South Sudan since December 2013. Destruction of schools and the departure of teachers
from many affected areas severely impact access to education, with 2 million children out of school—more than ever.

IMPACTS OF

MULTIPLE CRISES
More than 7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and
protection in South Sudan, as the cumulative effects of four years of conflict
and multiple, inter-related crises grow ever more debilitating. The spread of
the crisis to new areas has further compromised critical services to people in
need, resulting in shocks such as disease outbreaks and the collapse of markets.
In 2017, the conflict continued largely unabated, with
pervasive clashes across the regions and hotspots of violence
and insecurity arising in new locations. Major offensives
in Jonglei and Upper Nile have added to the continued mass
displacement and re-displacement of civilians, who have
frequently been caught in the crossfire and continue to be
deliberately targeted in violent attacks. Fighting has also
been intense in the Greater Equatoria region, causing record
numbers of South Sudanese people to flee to Uganda, where the
number of refugees surpassed 1 million in 2017. Some 58 per
cent of them are children and 56 per cent female. Tensions are
growing around areas where internally displaced people (IDPs)
are sheltering in the Equatorias as fighting persists, including
Kajo-keji county. The border towns of Kajo-keji and Kaya have
all but emptied since the beginning of 2017.
Continued fighting in Upper Nile, including on the western
bank of the River Nile, Renk, Mathiang, Longochuk and
Pagak, has caused tens of thousands of people to flee their
homes, with some moving to Sudan and Ethiopia. Intercommunal fighting, including cattle raids, has caused peaks
in tensions, displacement and deaths in areas of Jonglei, Lakes
and Western Equatoria.
New waves of displacement add to the already massive
numbers of South Sudanese who have fled their homes, as
families are repeatedly uprooted and remain on the move.
Protection concerns related to conflict and violence continue
to be the primary drivers of displacement. Yet, destitution and
hunger are increasingly being cited as reasons for leaving. In
a time of severe economic deterioration, the factors of high
inflation, limited access to basic resources such as fuel, and
deepening impacts of the conflict on agricultural production,
have meant that people remain on the move, continuing to
leave behind farms, livelihoods and more secure access to
food. People’s vulnerability to disease and malnutrition has
compounded due to multiple displacements.
The displacement trend has intensified in 2017, with
numbers fleeing across the borders from the Equatorias
reaching 350,000 from January to September alone. At the

4

same time, there is a sustained trend of people retreating
into more remote areas not easily accessible with assistance
and basic services. This is also likely to result in increasing
concentration of IDPs in camp-like settings in remote areas in
2018, particularly in the Equatorias and Greater Upper Nile,
which is an ongoing trend.
As conditions of violence and insecurity persist, killings,
attacks and violations—including sexual violence—have
become part of the reality of civilians’ lives. Protection
concerns are acute and widespread, both inside and outside
Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites and across 58 of 79
counties in South Sudan. A recent report found that the
clashes in Upper Nile in 2017 forcibly displaced tens of
thousands of people, while armed forces and allied militia
were responsible for deliberate killings, indiscriminate
attacks and systematic looting.5 Insecurity along key routes
and attacks on road convoys have resulted in the killing of
civilians. Attacks on aid workers and destruction and looting
of assets have forced hundreds of aid workers to relocate,
disrupting services to affected people.
The 1,324 cases of sexual and gender-based violence that were
reported in the first half of 2017 are the tip of the iceberg of
aggressions that largely go unreported and unchecked. These
chiefly affect women and girls, who represent 95 per cent of
the reported cases, while 19 per cent are children. Women have

been attacked in and outside the PoC sites, facing increased risk
as they venture to collect firewood, water and basic resources
for their families’ survival. As displaced communities settle far
from towns, in makeshift dwellings without proper privacy
and protection, women and girls are further exposed to sexual
violence. Pervasive gender-based violence consists not only
of rape or sexual assault, which represented 18 per cent of the
reported cases in 2017, but also harmful traditional practices,
including early and/or forced marriages that make up 12 per
cent of the cases.
Particularly vulnerable groups such as children, people
with disabilities and older people, suffer the most intense
consequences of sustained displacement, violence and lack
of access to services. In a country where children aged 3-17
represent 48 per cent of the population,6 the long-term effects
of multiple crises, loss of time in school, psychosocial stress
and other protection concerns will ripple into the decades to
come. Children continue to suffer the brunt of these pressures,
and their situation has deteriorated over 2017, with continued
incidents of recruitment, abuse, exploitation and other grave
violations amounting to have directly affected about 100,000
children since the beginning of the conflict. More than 19,000
children are estimated to have been recruited by armed actors,
up from 17,000 in 2016. The number of those registered
missing, separated and unaccompanied increased by 178 over
the course of the year. More than 16,000 unaccompanied and
separated children have been registered in South Sudan since
December 2013. Destruction of schools and the departure
of teachers from many affected areas mean that access to
education is severely impacted, with more children out of
school than ever.
In a context where more than half of the older people
interviewed for a study on humanitarian assistance had never
visited a local health centre, health post, clinic or hospital,7
reaching them with services while displaced from their homes
is even more difficult. Protection concerns for those living in
tents or poor, insecure conditions are acute. In 2017 attacks
on the western bank of the Nile, it was reported that older
and disabled people with reduced mobility and poor eyesight
were left behind when others fled the violence. Some were
burned in their homes and others faced looting and theft by
armed actors of what little food and property they had left to
survive.8

“What is the point of telling us we can
stay in our homes if then they steal our
food and leave us with nothing? We
can’t stay if we have no food.”
- Elderly woman from Ogot village recounting the
consequences of attacks by armed actors
Food insecurity is becoming more severe across a wider
area and is deepening for people already made vulnerable
by displacement and conflict. In 2017, food insecurity in

Unity, Jonglei and parts of Greater Equatoria and Greater Bahr
el Ghazal remained critical as spikes in conflict, economic
collapse and impacts of flooding reduced agricultural
production. About three quarters of counties countrywide are
expected to face severe food insecurity in the first quarter of
2018.
Even after the harvest in late 2017, food prices remained
high, and the 2018 lean season is projected to begin early and
become worse than in 2017. Particularly for people living in
market-dependent urban areas, economic decline has meant
a reduction in access to staple food and clean water, and to a
variety of foods. Conflict-affected and displaced households
in Greater Equatoria, Greater Upper Nile and Western
Bahr el Ghazal are reported to have alarming gaps in food
consumption, and are resorting to using savings or selling
productive assets, such as animals, seeds or land, to buy food.
More than 70 per cent of all households participating in a
recent vulnerability survey said that they had no food to eat
and went to sleep hungry at least once during the 30 days
preceding the survey.9

“Many people are suffering because
food commodities are very expensive.
Also many people are unable to
access their farms due to insecurity.”
- Female respondent to WFP Vulnerability
Assessment and Mapping (VAM) survey from
Yambio County
Insecurity and related displacement have undermined
already compromised agricultural production, destroying
the livelihoods of farmers and herders and causing food
shortages. Livestock have been looted or killed, crops
have been destroyed, and planting has been delayed due to
violence, displacement and unfavourable weather. In Greater
Equatoria, an area previously known as a major source of
food production, an outbreak of fall army worm is further
damaging farming and has already undermined production.
Late rains have worsened limited prospects in an area that
is all but empty as people have abandoned their farms and
land, their traditional source of income, for fear of violence.
Yambio is a key area of concern, though these trends have
intensified across the Equatorias in hotspots where insecurity
has peaked.10 These factors have exacerbated food shortages
in parts of the country where half the population is already
facing hunger. In a context where 78 per cent of households
depend on crop farming or animal husbandry as their
primary source of livelihood,11 these negative effects on
farming and livestock compound already severe vulnerability.
The nutrition situation has deteriorated steadily in the last
four years, as the factors driving hunger and malnutrition
have intensified in scale and severity. Nearly 1.1 million
children under age 5 and some 672,500 pregnant and lactating
women are estimated to be acutely malnourished. At the

5

Impacts of MULTIPLE crises

peak of the lean season in July 2017, eight out of the nine
states assessed12 showed global acute malnutrition (GAM)
rates above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent—up from
seven of ten in 2016. Apart from Central Equatoria, which
was lower (8 per cent), prevalence in the other areas ranged
from 18 per cent in Northern Bahr el Ghazal to 23 per cent in
Unity. A localized deterioration was also observed in Baggari
in Western Bahr el Ghazal, which consistently reported proxy
GAM rates above 17 per cent. Deterioration was especially
significant from 2016 to 2017 in Eastern Equatoria and Lakes.
Insecurity in Western Equatoria constrained the completion
of the survey, leaving a gap in the understanding of needs in
an area where the effects of continued clashes on food security
are believed to be immense.
While the overall level of food insecurity has risen to become
severe in more areas, the most dire life-threatening situations
are limited to a few more isolated locations. In early 2017,
famine was declared in two counties in Leer and Mayendit in
southern Unity, while at the peak of the lean season, 6 million
people were classified as severely food insecure. Death rates
higher than emergency threshold were reported in Mayendit
(Unity), and Kapoeta South and Torit (Eastern Equatoria).
It is projected that 48 per cent of households in South Sudan
will be classified as food insecure during first quarter of 2018.
Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) are
nine times more likely to die than their healthy peers, while
those with moderate acute malnutrition are three times more
likely to die.

As the nutrition situation has worsened every year for four
consecutive years, it means that an increasing number of
children suffering from prolonged undernutrition who
survive are becoming locked in a cycle of recurring illness
and faltering growth, with irreversible damage to their
development and cognitive abilities.
The deepening economic crisis is exacerbating
humanitarian needs, particularly for the urban poor.
Depreciation of the currency, rising prices of cereals and
shortages of imported commodities in local markets have
left people across the country struggling to feed their
families. The cost of living has continued to escalate, with
the Consumer Price Index increasing by 165 per cent from
August 2016 to August 2017. The effects are particularly acute
in urban areas, with inflation reaching 183 per cent in Juba
year on year.13 The average exchange rate was 180 SSP per US
dollar in the Juba parallel market, while the official rate was
130 SSP in October—this variability and divergence makes
it difficult for families to cope, especially the many who are
separated geographically. In urban areas, almost 80 per cent of
households surveyed reported to be using moderate or high
levels of negative coping strategies—such as skipping meals—
in a recent vulnerability assessment.14
Inconsistency and delays in payment of salaries to public
sector employees are translating to a continued breakdown
in the provision of critical primary services, impacting
basic education and health status, and affecting rule of law.

Economic need is also linked to increased criminality in many
areas, including the Equatorias, where civilians—including
humanitarian workers—are increasingly being affected by
theft, looting and related violent attacks. This will continue to
disrupt services to affected people. Economic deterioration
will undermine the ability to halt the spread of diseases like
cholera into new areas. With continued food insecurity,
malnutrition and weak access to services, morbidity and
mortality rates will likely increase in an already very
vulnerable population.

the road connecting the villages of Morobo and Kaya. Entire
villages were razed and abandoned.15
Destruction and looting of health-care facilities, attacks against
health workers, and shortages of skilled health professionals
mean access to health care is increasingly sparse in a country
where already some 80 per cent of health-care services are
managed by NGOs, with continuity of services reliant upon
funding. Between May and October 2017, three attacks against
health facilities in Central Equatoria, Lakes and Upper Nile
were reported, and another three incidents required health
worker evacuations across several locations. At least one in
ten health facilities have been affected, and up to 73 per cent
of those in the Equatorias are reported to be non-functional.
Ongoing conflict and insecurity in most affected areas are
preventing patients from seeking medical services, which
prevents timely attention and propagates the spread of diseases
like kala-azar. It also leaves non-communicable illnesses to
largely go untreated.

“If you are not healthy, you cannot
work. If someone from the household
is sick, we pay for the drugs instead of
buying food.”
- Female participant from Akobo West in a
REACH focus group discussion

Access to education remains a major challenge in a context
where education workers have been displaced and schools
have been occupied and destroyed as part of the conflict. A
national assessment has indicated that about 30 per cent of
primary schools had suffered at least one or more attacks
since December 2013 and 48 per cent of the schools are not
functioning. Already unfavourable student to teacher ratios16
have been worsened by education professionals leaving and
schools closing because of insecurity, for example in the

Equatorias, or giving up duties due to non-payment and loss
of value of salaries.
People are left increasingly susceptible to disease as access
to safe water and sanitation has deteriorated significantly
under conditions of protracted crisis and declining
investment in services. Debilitating outbreaks of cholera
have taken hold each year since the conflict began in 2013.
The latest outbreak has defied usual seasonal bounds to
become the longest-running and largest in magnitude and
geographical spread to date—starting in June 2016 and
expected to run into 2018—recording 21,551 cases and
causing 462 deaths as of 24 November, with a case fatality rate
of 2.1 per cent. Its persistence and reach are symptomatic of
the recurring and intensifying threats to the health of already
vulnerable people. Access to safe hygiene and clean water has
been compromised due to repeated displacement, insecurity
and damage to key infrastructure, increasing people’s
susceptibility to disease and the possibility of it resulting in
death. Fatality rates have been highest in counties with poor
access to health care, especially in islands and cattle camp
communities. In one of the hardest-hit counties, Budi in
Eastern Equatoria, where access is limited due to rains, the
case fatality rate reached 9.74 per cent in the second half of
2017 (83 deaths of 852 cases). These trends and feedback from
affected communities in PoC sites also point to the congestion
and poor living conditions, particularly in large camp settings.

are being stolen, water is not adequate
and the overall hygiene in the PoC is
very bad.”

Routine vaccine coverage of only 20 per cent in Jonglei,
Unity and Upper Nile means that preventable diseases like
measles spread unchecked—more than 1,000 suspected cases
have been reported in 2017. About 546,000 children under
age 5, mainly in Greater Upper Nile, were estimated to be
at risk of contracting measles. South Sudan faces various
endemic communicable diseases, including hepatitis E, that
are propagated by poor sanitation and overcrowded living
conditions. Cases of meningitis are on the rise in more remote
areas, including in Greater Bahr el Ghazal.
The parasitic disease kala-azar poses a persistent threat, as it is
fatal if untreated and can kill those with weak immune systems
within weeks. In 2017, it has taken the lives of at least 56 people
and sickened more than 2,700 in South Sudan. Given poor
reach and quality of services and reporting, health partners
have warned that many more are likely to be infected, and
environmental change favouring the proliferation of sand-flies
that spread the disease has escalated the problem. Violence and
displacement in the Greater Equatoria region have severely
affected populations with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS
and disrupted access to life-saving treatment.

DISPLACEMENT

The cumulative effects of poor living conditions,
malnutrition and inadequate services in a context
of conflict and massive displacement have weakened
resistance to illnesses and made them more life-threatening
for crisis-affected people. Malaria continues to be a prevalent
threat, as it accounts for 61 per cent of all illnesses reported
in health facilities across the country and is the leading cause
of death from disease in South Sudan (representing 70 per
cent of disease-related deaths in November 2017). More than
2.2 million cases have been reported since the beginning of
2017, resulting in more than 1,000 reported deaths. More
than 77,500 people are infected every week, most of whom
are children under age 5. In addition to generally limited
availability of health services across the country, challenges
with the supply chain to deliver malaria drugs has weakened
people’s access to timely treatment.

Impacts of MULTIPLE crises

People from neighbouring countries taking refuge in South
Sudan face threats to their safety and well-being as they
settle in conditions which perpetuate their vulnerability.
At the end of 2017, some 279,000 refugees were being
hosted in South Sudan, a number which is expected to reach
304,560 in 2018. Most came because of the ongoing fighting
in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in Sudan and settled
predominantly in 21 refugee locations in Unity and Upper
Nile. A smaller number of refugees from the Central African
Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia have
been displaced on a protracted basis, and are mostly settled in
Central and Western Equatoria.
Continued clashes in conflict-affected areas leave refugees
subject to attacks, and drive them to areas where their access
to food and basic resources and livelihood options are limited.
Particularly in the north, protection is compromised by
people remaining under emergency or makeshift shelters
after years of displacement, with little capacity to improve
these conditions. Competition for scarce resources has led
to tensions between refugee and host communities, further
aggravating the situation for refugees. Apart from insecurity
and violence and proximity to armed elements, major
protection concerns include recruitment of children, sexual
and gender-based violence, insufficient food and education
facilities, and limited economic opportunities and skills
training are their major protection concerns. As a result, refugees
in camps will continue to rely heavily on life saving multi-sectoral
assistance.
The risk of epidemics among refugees continues and gaps
remain in providing comprehensive services specifically in
HIV/AIDS, chronic diseases, mental health and psychosocial
support, and maternal and new born care. Results from the
2017 nutrition surveys showed an average GAM prevalence
of 9.1 per cent and SAM prevalence of 1.7 per cent among
children aged 6-59 months for the refugee camps, indicating

FOOD INSECURITY

5 10

poor nutrition status. Food insecurity has also worsened,
with post distribution monitoring results reporting 29 per
cent of refugees with acceptable food consumption scores.
Some 60 per cent of refugees, especially in the northern
camps, remain under emergency or makeshift shelters after
years of displacement, with little self-capacity to shift to
semi-permanent shelter. There is a considerable gap in shelter
improvement due to continuous arrival of refugees and
general population growth in camps. Access to camps like
Lasu and Ezo is no longer possible, and access to other camps
in Equatoria continues to be a concern.

“We need milling vouchers because
people are forced to sell some of their
food ration to grind their grains and it
results in little food left. Food ration need
to be increased because it is very little.”
- Male refugee in a focus group discussion
at Jamjang
The economic crisis has also impacted the lives of refugees
and host communities, with approximately 80 per cent of
host and refugee populations facing food scarcity, limited
livelihood options, and gap in food supply. Competition for
scarce resources has led to high tensions between refugee
and host communities, further aggravating the situation for
refugees.
Access to education also remains a big challenge for refugee
children and the learner-teacher ratio is still at 150:1.
Children in urban and peri-urban Juba struggle to access
education due to closure of public schools because of limited
government funding, while insecurity and conflict disrupted
all education activities in Lasu refugee camp in Yei County.

CAMP COORDINATION AND CAMP MANAGEMENT
OVERVIEW

NO. OF PEOPLE IN NEED

An estimated 827,000 people will require direct
Camp Coordination and Camp Management
(CCCM) services in 2018. This includes nearly
300,000 internally displaced people (IDPs)
of whom about 210,000 reside in UNMISS Protection
of Civilians (PoC) sites, more than 27,700 in informal
settlements, and more than 58,000 in collective centres. In
addition to already recognised sites, CCCM will contribute to
community stabilization for 527,000 IDPs and surrounding
host communities in other camp-like settings in Central
Equatoria, Jonglei, Unity, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el
Ghazal. Furthermore, an estimated 304,560 refugees will be in
need of CCCM services by the end of 2018.

A total of 827,000 IDPs in camps and camp-like settings and
surrounding host communities in Central Equatoria, Jonglei,
Unity, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal will remain
of concern to CCCM Cluster throughout 2018. Unity, Upper
Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal continue to host the highest
number of displaced people in need of CCCM services in
camp and camp like settings. However, the expansion and
intensification of the conflict at different times and in different
locations in the country continue to cause people to seek refuge
in recognized sites as well as in other camp-like settings where
perception of safety is gained by living together.

HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND DRIVERS
Since the December 2013 crisis in South Sudan, IDPs have
continued to seek refuge in PoC sites, collective centres and
settlements. IDPs cite insecurity as the main driver of decisions
to remain in displacement in camps and camp-like settings.

During 2017, new fighting and violence in Central Equatoria,
Jonglei, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal increased the
population of IDPs in Wau by 20,000 and in Bor by 800. In
Upper Nile, one spontaneous settlement was created in Aburoc
with 10,000 IDPs and, in Central Equatoria, three settlements
in Kajo-keji were hosting 17,000 IDPs respectively. Living
conditions in these sites remain dire due to heavy congestion
that exposes the IDPs to risks including mental health, disease,
insecurity and protection, particularly for women and girls. In
Western Bahr el Ghazal, IDPs in the protective site in Wau are
living in spaces of 6.1 square metres (m2 ) per person while in
some of the collective sites, the average space per person is less
than 3 m2, far below the Sphere standard of 30 m2 per person.

EDUCATION
OVERVIEW

NO. OF PEOPLE IN NEED

By the end of 2017, some 1.7 million children
aged 3-17 years (58 per cent boys and 42 per
cent girls) were in need of education services
as the conflict continued to severely impact the
already fragile education system. Before the conflict began
in 2013, 73 per cent of men and 84 per cent of women above
15 years of age were illiterate and three out of five school-age
children were not enrolled in primary school.18 Although
a few indicators have improved,19 the national assessment
conducted by the Education Cluster in 2017 showed that 11
per cent of primary schools open in the beginning of 2017
were no longer functional in October-November, and that 30
per cent of primary schools had suffered at least one attack
since December 2013. In addition, some 158,000 refugee
children in South Sudan will be in need of pre-school,
primary and secondary education assistance in 2018.

Children aged 3-17 represent some 48 per cent of the
population20, and they have borne the brunt of the immediate
impact and long-term effects of violence and displacement.
The interruption of learning will have serious short- and
long-term consequences for the stability and development of
South Sudan as children missing out on school lack structured
opportunity for healthy cognitive, physical, linguistic, social
and emotional development during this critical phase of
growth. Another consequence of the lack of continued access
to quality education is the potential fuelling of new conflicts,
with an estimated 19,000 children already recruited into armed
groups.21

HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND DRIVERS
Fighting, displacement and emergency levels of food
insecurity have interrupted education for children. Disease

outbreaks such as cholera have also interrupted access to
education as many schools have to close and children are
not able to fully participate. In the areas where education
continued, the quality of teaching deteriorated due to missed
opportunities to train teachers and delays in payment of
salaries.
This interruption of education will have immediate, medium
and long-term consequences for the stability and development
of South Sudan. Apart from missed development, the longer
children stay out of school, the more vulnerable they are to
forced recruitment by armed actors. Children, parents and the
communities consider education a critical priority.

EMERGENCY SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS
NO. OF PEOPLE IN NEED BY STATUS

OVERVIEW
It is estimated that of the 1.9 million IDPs in
South Sudan, many of whom have been displaced
multiple times, about 1.7 million will need some
sort of emergency shelter and/or non-food item
(ES/NFI) support in 2018. This includes the majority of nearly
300,000 IDPs living in PoCs and other camp-like settings
and collective centres, 1.22 million IDPs living outside PoCs
and 82,257 host communities who will require new shelters
or reinforcement of existing infrastructure. In addition,
some 304,560 refugees are expected to need shelter and NFI
assistance in 2018.

AFFECTED PEOPLE
The need for emergency shelter will remain high among IDPs
in PoCs and collective sites in particular, as they do not have
alternative sources of shelter materials. IDPs outside camps, on
the other hand, will require basic household items, particularly
those who have been displaced multiple times. Women and
children remain especially vulnerable to protection risks due to
lack of shelter. A small number of host community members
will also require assistance due to pressure on their limited
resources to support displaced populations. In addition, it is
estimated that pockets of populations returning to border areas,
such as the Ugandan border in Central and Eastern Equatoria
and the western bank of the River Nile in Upper Nile, will also
need shelter and NFI assistance.

After four years of conflict and protracted displacement, the
coping mechanisms of the displaced communities have been
eroded. Those that are willing to return to relatively stable
areas, such as areas in the Equatoria or the catchment areas
of Bentiu PoC, will face challenges to re-establish themselves
in the short- and medium-term because of weak and volatile
security, and due to house and land property rights.

The ongoing conflict compounded by the economic crisis
will continue to drive ES/NFI needs in 2018 as people fleeing
fighting are forced to leave behind basic household items
and shelter materials, and the economic crisis weakens their
purchasing power and access to markets.

Emergency shelter and NFI supplies, including blankets,
sleeping mats, mosquito nets, plastic sheets, kitchen sets, bags,
solar lamps and kangas (a large piece of cloth used as clothing,
for carrying personal items or protection infants), are critical
to ensuring the health, safety and dignity of South Sudan’s
most conflict-affected populations.

FOOD SECURITY AND LIVELIHOODS
OVERVIEW

NO. OF PEOPLE IN NEED

5.7M

In 2018, the food security situation is likely to
deteriorate for the fifth consecutive year with
5.4 million people projected to be severely food
insecure in January – March 2018. This is the
highest number of severely food insecure people at this time
of year since the start of the crisis. With no end in sight to the
conflict, economic crisis and disease outbreaks, the 2018 lean
season is projected to begin earlier and become worse than in
2017. The conflict has also disrupted natural resource based
livelihoods and the cereal deficit of 500,000 metric tons in 2017
is expected to be worse in 2018, especially with the conflict
expanding into the Greater Equatoria region–the country’s
former ‘bread basket’. In addition, 304,560 refugees are projected
to require food assistance and access to livelihoods in 2018.

insecurity to unprecedented levels. Reduced cereal production,
especially in the ‘bread basket’ regions due to conflict, and the
increase in disease outbreaks and other seasonal and climatic
shocks such as floods, drought spells and crop and livestock
diseases and pests, including the fall army worm infestation,
have also further undermined people’s resilience by depleting
household assets. The affected populations are increasingly
adopting negative coping strategies by reducing meals, going
without food or selling their last animals. This is reflected in
food consumption gaps, reduced dietary diversity and increased
household hunger scores. Livelihoods have been decimated
by the crisis with limited access to land, reduced harvests,
fear of violence preventing cultivation of new fields, loss of
livestock, loss of assets, and limited investments in market-based
employment opportunities, ever-deepening poverty, vulnerability
and food insecurity making it increasingly difficult for affected
populations to recover.

HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND DRIVERS
The combination of protracted conflict and violence resulting in
large scale displacement, and the economic crisis, characterized
by rising prices and worsening terms of trade for cereals in
exchange for labour or livestock, has continued to drive food

Conflict-affected and displaced households are facing alarming
food consumption gaps, asset depletion and high acute
malnutrition rates. Hotspots with populations at an elevated risk
of famine were identified in Ayod, Kapoeta East, Nyirol and Wau.
The economic crisis is further worsening access to food across
the whole country and especially for the market-dependent
urban populations. Food insecurity is also deteriorating in
other areas previously unaffected by conflict, such as Lakes and
Warrap, through a combination of hyper-inflation and intensified
communal conflict. The depressed economy will also compound
needs and reliance on assistance due to lack of opportunities
for employment. Older people, children under age 5 as well as
those from single (mainly women) headed households are most
vulnerable to food insecurity.

HEALTH
OVERVIEW

NO. OF PEOPLE IN NEED

The combination of conflict and economic
crisis has weakened the health system across the
country, with an estimated 4.8 million South
Sudanese people in need of assistance to access
health-care services in 2018. Some 304,560 refugees will also
require health assistance in 2018. Of the 1,893 health facilities,
419 (22 per cent) are non-functional, and 955 are functioning
at 10 per cent of their capacity due to a combination of
extensive looting and vandalization, critical loss of human
resources, frequent stock outs of drugs and pharmaceuticals,
and fiscal delays. Communicable diseases have spread in
2017, including cholera which has reached new locations
along the River Nile and persisted in the Equatorias. There
has also been a notable increase in malaria cases in the Bahr
el Ghazals.

5.1M
SEVERITYSeverity
MAP

Displaced people face the most complex challenges in accessing
health care, particularly those who have fled to remote areas.
Children under age 5 are particularly vulnerable to disease,
including due to the low level of routine immunization and
poor nutrition status. Survivors of gender-based violence have
inadequate access to services and women do not have adequate
access to skilled personnel during pregnancy and childbirth.
People living with HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis, mental health
and disabilities have been cut-off from life-saving treatment by
the conflict and the lack of resources due to the economic crisis.

HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND DRIVERS
The conflict has taken a major toll on the health care system, with
the Equatorias, Jonglei and Upper Nile being the hardest hit. In
this context, humanitarian partners have continued to provide up
to 80 per cent of health care services in South Sudan, with continuity of services relying on availability of funding. Since 2016, for
example, disruptions in financial flows have affected health-care
services in many parts of Jonglei and Upper Nile. South Sudan

example reached historic levels in 2017, persisting longer than
ever before in the Equatorias and reaching remote areas along the
River Nile and other areas for the first time. In 2016, the WHOUNICEF estimate of national immunization coverage for Penta3
vaccine, which prevents the most common preventable and
potentially deathly diseases was 26 per cent below the globally
recommended target of at least 80 per cent. Current efforts to
reach the conflict-affected locations of Jonglei, Unity and Upper

challenges recording a minimal response of 7 out 32 counties to

programmes increased by 23 per cent in 2017 compared to
the same period in 2016, while children with moderate acute

People in conflict-affected areas are especially vulnerable
to malnutrition, in part due to often disrupted health and
nutrition services. Children under age 5, and pregnant
and lactating women are the most vulnerable groups to
acute malnutrition due to their increased biological and
physiological needs. Other vulnerable groups include older
people, tuberculosis patients and people living with HIV/
AIDS. The Greater Bahr el Ghazal and Greater Upper Nile
regions continue to have the highest prevalence of acute
malnutrition for the last four years. In 2017, children in
Eastern Equatoria and Lakes showed significant high levels of
acute malnutrition compared to the previous three years.

HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND DRIVERS
The conflict and increasing levels of food insecurity worsened

In the first half of 2017, these factors resulted in closure of

some 304,560 refugees in South Sudan will need protection

scope, with increasing numbers of areas newly affected by the
armed conflict and instability. Parties to the conflict repeatedly
fail to respect provisions of international humanitarian and
human rights law protecting civilian populations and their

protection needs are far from being met as protection actors
continue to face daunting challenges to respond effectively to
growing protection needs throughout the country.

women of all ages are at risk of abduction, injury and killings in
addition to all forms of gender-based violence (GBV), including
sexual violence, in their homes and public spaces. Children
are the majority of the people in need. Approximately one
in every three South Sudanese have been forced to flee their
homes and are either internally displaced or have sought refuge
in neighbouring countries. The proliferation of the crises and
resulting displacement places extremely vulnerable individuals

the PoC sites, rates of criminality, sexual and gender-based
violence, and self-inflicted harm are increasing. Outside the
PoC sites, survivors of the worst forms of violence, like rape
and torture, have little to no access to specialized life-saving

in four out of five counties assessed in 2017.23 In a recent
survey, 48 per cent of female respondents reported that a
woman or girl in their household had experienced some form
of GBV in the previous 12 months.24

Constraints on humanitarian access hamper the delivery
of protection to the most affected areas of the country and
the identification of and response to the needs of the most
vulnerable. Further, the need to respond to immediate lifethreatening emergencies has reduced capacity to address
other protection concerns such as those of street children,
incarcerated or exploited children, and women and girls
exposed to harmful traditional practices, as well as housing,
land and property concerns that hinder durable solutions for
displaced persons.

Up to 60 per cent of the population in need in South Sudan are
children who continue to be exposed to threats of recruitment,
abuse, neglect, abduction, exploitation and violence. Around
117,000 children have been directly affected by more than 3,700
incidents of grave child rights violations registered since the
beginning of the conflict. More than 19,000 children affiliated
with armed groups need to be demobilized. More than 12,000
unaccompanied or separated children need access to family
tracing and reunification. Children released from armed
forces and groups are also in need of social and economic
reintegration, psycho-social support, and other critical services.

Gender-based violence is pervasive, yet grossly underreported throughout South Sudan due to fear of retaliation
from perpetrators and social stigma, particularly for male
survivors. Life-saving services and reporting mechanisms are
not immediately available to survivors in many of the affected
areas. Conflict-related sexual violence is a serious concern.
Women and girls, particularly in female- and child-headed
households, remain the most at risk, and they are most
vulnerable to sexual assault while carrying out the most basic
acts of survival. Economic desperation has resulted in more
families seeking to ease hardships with dowry payments from
forced and child marriages. Sexual violence was commonly
reported as a primary concern for women by key informants

Numerous counties and a vast network of routes are affected
by widespread contamination from explosive remnants of
war across the country, with five new hazardous areas being
discovered each day. Landmines and unexploded ordnance
pose a constant threat of injury or death to the civilian
population and humanitarian workers equally, and currently
render at least 166 schools and 44 clinics unsafe for use.
Explosive hazards make the movement of populations fleeing
from conflict into unfamiliar areas or returning to their place
of origin more dangerous and impede the socio-economic
development of communities.

sanitation. Half of the population does not have access to
improved water sources, with about 35 per cent of the existing
boreholes estimated to be non-functional. Open defecation is
persistent in 61 per cent of settlements in the country. Only
28 per cent of the population have access to a borehole within
30 minutes’ walk.

HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND DRIVERS
WASH infrastructure has been deliberately targeted by
armed actors during the conflict, leaving most of the water
infrastructure in conflict-affected areas destroyed. Internal
displacement puts a strain on existing water sources and
increases WASH needs. The deteriorating economic situation
has made it difficult for the population to afford safe water,
as in most locations, the price per litre has doubled while
outside Juba the price has tripled compared to late 2016.
With congested populations, both in crowded PoC sites and
urban areas, water-borne diseases spread rapidly. The ongoing
cholera outbreak, which has spread to new areas, is both a
consequence and a cause of WASH needs. High malnutrition
rates are also linked to poor WASH conditions, as exemplified
in the diarrhoea-malnutrition cycle prevalent in vulnerable
populations.

The most vulnerable members of the population are in the
greatest need of WASH support, particularly the internally
displaced. This includes the severely malnourished and
food insecure, who are prone to water-borne and waterrelated diseases. Children under age 5 are especially at risk.
People living in PoC sites and collective centres depend on
a consistent supply of safe water, sanitation and hygiene
services, and the displaced communities living outside of
PoCs are frequently deprived of WASH support due to access
containts and insecurity. Lack of water compounds risks for
women and girls, who are often exposed to violence when
walking to remote water sources. In urban areas, people
struggle to access safe water due to ever-rising prices. People
in conflict-affected counties have lower access to safe water
than the country average of 50 per cent. In 2017, for example,
only 9 per cent of the population in Magwi County, 13 per
cent in Fashoda County and 17 per cent in Panyikang County
could reach boreholes.

INFORMATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
vulnerable to localized conflicts, resulting in destruction and
looting. Given these challenges, the humanitarian community
will continue to rely on costly air transportation almost yearround with the cost of airlifts, at its highest point, being eight
times higher than road transportation.

OVERVIEW
South Sudan remains one of the most logistically challenging
places in the world. The already under-developed roads and
airstrips deteriorate every year with cumulative effects of
heavy rains and lack of maintenance. From July to December,
more than 70 per cent of roads are inaccessible. Only 192
kilometres of the vast country’s road network is sealed. Most
of the 280 airstrips are suitable only for helicopter landing for
humanitarian operations. During the wet season, fewer than
10 airstrips are suitable for landing a fixed-wing plane. The
majority of the ports along the rivers are in unusable or very
basic condition. With the absence of heavy lifting equipment,
most ports rely on manual loading and offloading, which
increases the turnaround time for barges. Insecurity along the
rivers also makes them a less reliable option for transport.
The deteriorating infrastructure, lack of maintenance,
cumulative effects of long and heavy rainy seasons, and
disruption of road access by insecurity have left the
humanitarian community with limited options to deliver relief
items. During the dry season, insecurity along the main supply
routes is a major challenge restricting movement and increasing
transportation costs due to a high risk operational environment
for transporters. Relief items pre-positioned in the field are also

Communication options vary considerably across South
Sudan, as there is not a single communication channel that
covers all the country due to gaps in coverage and defective
infrastructure. Despite the poor state of the telecommunication
infrastructure, the language and lack of trust are the most
widely reported barriers to news and information access in the
country, according to a recent survey.25 The most frequently
reported primary news channels of IDPs are the radio (29 per
cent) and in person interaction (29 per cent) followed by the
telephone (21 per cent). Most of those who rely on direct faceto-face interaction receive news from their family and friends.
Many women reported that they tend to receive the news last.
Drums, cow horn blowing, smoke signals, war songs, shouting
and sending runners to spread news from one location to
the next are still common practices. Mobile communication
in particular is making these forms of communication less
relevant, however mobile penetration does not exceed 23 per
cent of the population in South Sudan, according to the most
recent estimates.

METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION GAPS

METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION GAPS
Humanitarian partners continue to face challenges in
accessing and providing concrete data in South Sudan. All
population data since the 2008 census has been based on
projections, an effort that has been complicated by the high
degree of displacement and mortality during the conflict.
Sex and age disaggregated data is scarce due to the absence
of accurate baseline data. In an effort to ensure strict
prioritization of needs, the HNO applied the September
2017 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)
baseline population that was adjusted to take into account
refugee outflows since the beginning of the conflict, and other
population movements within the country, including in the
population of IDPs in PoCs, and annual growth rates.
The number of people in need for each sector was determined
based on the following calculations:
CCCM: The number of people in need was calculated by
adding the number of registered and head count of IDP
population living in recognised PoC sites, collective centres
and settlements plus those in other camp-like settings in areas
where CCCM already has presence.
Education: The number of people in need was calculated
by using two indicators: the percentage of drop outs and
percentage of children not attending school regularly (for
example due to lack of food or school closure because
of looting). To arrive at a percentage of male and female
students, net enrolment ratio was used (EMIS 2016-National
Education Statistics).
Emergency Shelter/Non-Food Items: The number of
people in need includes IDPs living in PoC sites, IDPs
living in collective centres, IDPs living outside PoC sites,
host communities, returnees, and other disaster affected
populations. The cluster does not have any comparative
prioritization proxy indicator collected countrywide that
reflects, predicts and quantifies the sector needs, but it does
have a very accurate methodology to respond based on
needs. Within this methodology (i.e. assessment, verification/
registration and distribution standard formats) partners
collect data with regards to the overall population in need
and the cluster-specific population in need for each location
served.
Food Security and Livelihoods: Trends in the IPC data from
2013-2017 were used to project the number of people who
will be food insecure during the lean season in 2018.
Health: All IDPs in PoCs and informal settlements were
targeted. Estimates for emergency health assistance were
calculated using several variables. Disease burden, outbreak
and immunizations in all counties were weighted for
severity and scored within a range of 1-5 with 5 depicting
severe challenges along all health systems parameters. These
were superimposed on IPC locations of concern and new

28 28

population displacements to arrive at targets of 70 per cent
(5), 60 per cent (4), 50 per cent (3), 40 per cent (2 and 1)
in an IPC concerned location, 30 per cent (2) and 20 per
cent (1). Given that the HNO allows for emerging relevant
issues borne out of response assessments and observations,
contextual judgments on severe acute malnutrition with
medical complications, status of WASH in health facilities,
locations with major funding disruptions and health service
functionality were also factored in to fine tune targets for
focussed intervention.
Nutrition: The caseload for MAM and SAM were estimated
by multiplying the prevalence of SAM and MAM in a
particular county with the under-five population times
a correction factor of 2.6 to cater for incidence of acute
malnutrition as recommended by WHO. The prevalence
of SAM and MAM was estimated from the latest SMART
surveys conducted in respective counties in 2017. In counties
where there was no survey, Food Security and Nutrition
Monitoring System (FSNMS) was used to provide estimates of
SAM and MAM prevalence for estimating the people in need.
The caseload for blanket supplementary feeding programming
(BSFP) was estimated based on the 2017 coverage of 58
WFP counties including 8 in Central and Eastern Equatoria.
The counties targeted for BSFP normally have high levels
of acute malnutrition with GAM ≥15 per cent. BSFP can
be implemented in new locations, as long there is evidence
of deterioration of nutrition, as it was done in 2017 in the
Equatorias, which were not planned in 2017. The caseload
for Maternal and Young Child Nutrition counselling was
estimated by taking 12 per cent of the total population (4 per
cent pregnant, 4 per cent under age 1 and 4 per cent under
age 2).
Protection: The Protection Cluster made the following
assumptions when calculating people in need:
a. People in need of some form of protection:
• The entire IDP caseload (1.88 million).
• Vulnerable and at risk members of the host communities
are considered proportionately based on the percentage
of IDPs being hosted by the community: The higher
percentage of IDPs in relation to host community, the
larger the impact on the host community and the larger
percentage of the host community will be in need of some
form of protection.
• People in need of protection in counties that are heavily
affected by violence are calculated proportionately by the
number of incidents from Armed Conflict Location &
Event Data Project (ACLED) data, excluding incidents
with little to no impact on the protection environment.
b. Additional counties in need of some form of protection:

methodology and information gaps

• Counties that have a high number of unaccompanied,
separated or missing children (>100) are in need of family
tracing and reunification.
• Counties with high levels of mine/UXO contamination
(>5 hazards) are in need of protection through survey and
clearance activities.
WASH: The key drivers for emergency WASH response in
the current context are the IDP population, GAM rates and
cholera outbreaks. The people in need was calculated as
described in the following steps:
• The affected population was divided into five severity
intervals for each of the following parameters: a) IDP
population numbers, b) GAM rates, c) number of cholera
cases (2014-2017), d) percentage of assessed settlements
with access to a borehole under 30 minutes, and e) % of
assessed settlements with 50% or more using latrines.26
•A
 n average was taken of the rank scored within each
parameter, to determine people in need for geographic
locations with highest WASH needs applying a logic
formula. While calculating the average, more weight
was given to IDP population data, GAM rates, and
number of cholera cases, as the data reliability is higher
as compared to data under (d & e); although this data was
referred to but only 1/3 weight was given to it during the
calculations.

Overall: The overall number of people in need was calculated
by reviewing the number of people in need by sector by
county and selecting the highest sectoral number in each
county to reduce duplication. The refugee caseload was then
added to the total for each sector. Protection figures were
excluded from the calculations given that they include both
direct and indirect needs.
Community feedback: To reflect the voices of affected people
in the HNO, Internews analyzed 2,365 pieces of community
feedback it collected between January and September 2017,
and conducted 59 focus group discussions (FGD) and five
key informant interviews (KII) in September 2017 across
three PoC sites (Bentiu, Malakal and UN House) and three
refugee camps/settlements (Ajoung Thok, Pamir and Yida)
where Internews humanitarian information service operates.
Each focus group discussion involved the participation of
9-10 individuals for a total of approximately 550 individuals
participating in the survey across the country. Focus groups
consisted of women’s groups, men’s groups, youth groups,
mixed groups and community leaders. The community
feedback was collected from Humanitarian Information
Service radio stations/Boda boda talk talk and through
call-ins, listening groups and correspondents reaching out to
residents. REACH provided additional focus group reports to
inform the analysis.

•F
 inally, in counties where the IDP population was higher
than the weighted PIN, the IDP population size was
considered as people in need.

Assessment data: The amount of available data improved
in 2017, including through: improvements in assessment
methodology for the Initial Rapid Needs Assessment; better
cross-referencing and complementarity between different
data collection efforts (including Biometric Registration,
Village Assessment Survey, Area of Knowledge data and
IRNAs); expanded collection of Crude Death Rate data
through the SMART surveys led by the Nutrition Cluster;
and sector-specific surveys carried out at cluster-level, such
as the Education Cluster’s assessment of school functionality

in November 2017. However, there continue to be gaps in the
humanitarian community’s knowledge regarding the needs
across the country, and the timing of the assessments could be
better adapted to the planning cycle.
Humanitarian partners continue to work to further refine
population and displacement estimates to better determine
the location and number of people in need.
