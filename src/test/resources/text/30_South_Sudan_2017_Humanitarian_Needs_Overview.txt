humanitarian

needs & key figures
Over the past year, the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan has deepened and
spread, affecting people in areas previously considered stable and exhausting
the coping capacity of those already impacted. Three years on from the
outbreak of conflict in December 2013, nearly 7.5 million people are in need of
humanitarian assistance and protection across the country as a result of armed
conflict, inter-communal violence, economic crisis, disease outbreaks and
climatic shocks.
Humanitarian needs
New clashes have left one in four people uprooted. More than three million people have been forced to flee their homes
since the conflict began in December 2013, including nearly 1.9 million people who have been internally displaced1 (with 50 per
cent estimated to be children2) and more than 1.2 million who have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries, bringing the total
number of South Sudanese refugees in the region to more than 1.3 million.
Civilians face violations, including widespread sexual violence. Although there is no formal death toll for the
South Sudan conflict, tens of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed since December 2013. One study of 24
communities in Unity found that nearly 8,000 people had been killed or drowned fleeing fighting over a one-year period during
the conflict.3 Mortality has been exacerbated by conflict, acute malnutrition and disease, with 13 out of 44 counties surveyed in
2016 having crude death rates (CDR) above the emergency threshold of 1 death per 10,000 people per day. There continue to be
reports of sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, committed by all parties to the conflict.
Hunger and malnutrition have reached historic levels. At the height of the lean season in July 2016, some 4.8 million
people – more than one in every three people in South Sudan – were estimated to be severely food insecure. This number is
expected to rise as high as five million in 2017. The food security situation is at the most compromised level since the crisis
commenced in 2013- the combination of conflict, economic crisis and lack of adequate levels of agricultural production
have eroded vulnerable households ability to cope. More than one million children under age 5 are estimated to be acutely
malnourished, including more than 273,600 who are severely malnourished.
The economic crisis has escalated, leaving the urban poor increasingly desperate and destitute. The South
Sudanese Pound (SSP) rapidly depreciated in 2016, reaching an all-time low of more than 100 SSP to 1 US Dollar in November
2016. The cost of living has risen exponentially, with the South Sudan annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 835.7
per cent from October 2015 to October 2016, the highest year-on-year inflation rate in the world. Insecurity along main roads
has diminished trade and trader’s ability to access hard currency for imports. In September 2016, 51 per cent of households in
Juba were food insecure, more than double the 2015 level of 23 per cent, and this number is expected to continue to increase.
Susceptibility to disease has risen after three years of conflict and crisis. More than 2 million cases of malaria were
reported from January to November 2016; an increase compared to the same period in 2015. The cholera outbreak in 2016
caused more cases and spread to more locations than in 2015. There are rising cases of the deadly tropical disease kala-azar and
more than twice the number of counties have been affected by measles outbreaks in 2016 (13) compared to 2015 (5).
The children of the world’s youngest nation are at risk. More than 1.17 million children aged 3 to 18 years old have lost
access to education due to conflict and displacement since December 2013. About 31 per cent of schools open have suffered at
least one or more attacks by armed actors. This has overwhelmingly been the case in Greater Upper Nile, specifically in urban
areas. Over 17,000 children are estimated to have been recruited by armed actors in South Sudan. Over 9,000 children were
registered as unaccompanied, separated or missing at the time of writing. Anecdotal evidence indicates that child marriage is
increasing due to conflict and economic pressures. An estimated one million children are believed to be in psychological distress.

Impacts of multiple & deepening crises

Impacts of multiple &

deepening crises
Across South Sudan, nearly 7.5 million people are in need of humanitarian
assistance and protection as a result of multiple and deepening crises,
including conflict, inter-communal violence, economic decline, disease,
and climatic shocks, which have led to displacement, distress, destitution
and death.
Over the course of 2016, the conflict in South Sudan spread
beyond the Greater Upper Nile to new locations, including
the Greater Equatoria region and Western Bahr el Ghazal.
In the first half of the year, fighting – including violations
against civilians - was reported in Wau town and surrounding
areas in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Malakal in Upper Nile, Pibor
in Jonglei, Mundri and Yambio in Western Equatoria, and
Lobonok and Terekeka in Central Equatoria. In July 2016,
clashes erupted in South Sudan’s capital city, Juba, sparking
the escalation of conflict in multiple other locations in the
latter half of the year, including in the Greater Equatoria
region and Unity. In Central Equatoria, Yei became a major
hotspot, with reports of violations against civilians by both
parties, including killing, abduction, rape and restrictions on
freedom of movement. In Unity, tens of thousands of people
were again forced to flee far into the swamps and islands in
search of safety when fighting broke out in and around Leer.
Many of these people have now been displaced multiple times,
having also survived the major offensive that took place in
these areas from May to October 2015. In addition to armed
conflict, communities are struggling with inter-communal
violence, including as a result of cattle raiding. In Lakes, for
example, at least 589 people were killed and some 484 people
were injured from 1 January to 16 November 2016.

Violations against civilians continue to be widely reported.
Although there is no formal death toll for the South Sudan
conflict, tens of thousands of people are estimated to have
been killed. One study of 24 communities in Unity found
that nearly 8,000 people had been killed or drowned fleeing
fighting over a one-year period during the conflict.5 Sexual
and gender-based violence has been used as a weapon of war
and a reward for fighters. From January to September 2016,
more than one in five cases of gender-based violence reported
to humanitarian partners involved sexual violence, mainly
perpetrated by armed actors.6 Throughout displacement,
women and girls are at heightened risk of attack and exposed
to significant levels of sexual violence, particularly when
collecting firewood and food, even in close proximity to the
Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites. Sexual and gender-based
violence can have grave impacts on victims and survivors,
including death, physical injury, disability, psychological
trauma, unwanted pregnancy and social rejection, while
child marriage can have severe consequences, including
discontinuation of education, psychological distress,
obstructed labour and obstetric fistula. The impact of
such violence is further compounded by lack of access to
appropriate health care, including clinical management of
rape, as well as a lack of redress and access to justice.

Impacts of multiple & deepening crises

Around one in four people in South Sudan have been forced
to flee their homes, including more than 1.3 million people
who have fled to neighbouring countries as refugees and nearly
1.9 million people who are internally displaced, the majority
of whom are children. The number of people displaced by the
conflict escalated dramatically following the eruption of conflict
in Juba in July 2016. Thousands of people fled South Sudan
every day to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. In October,
an average of 3,500 South Sudanese crossed out of South
Sudan daily predominantly to Uganda, Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) and Ethiopia, with smaller numbers to
Sudan and Kenya. Over 85 per cent of the refugees arriving in
neighbouring countries are women and children. The biggest
outflow was into Uganda, with around 2,400 new arrivals
each day in October, the majority of whom were fleeing from
the Greater Equatoria region. Inside South Sudan, internal
displacement also spiked. In Eastern Equatoria, internal
displacement tripled from about 46,000 in August to about
158,000 in October, while in Central Equatoria, the number
of internally displaced people (IDPs) more than doubled from
July (71,000) to October (143,000). Elsewhere, civilians who
had already been displaced multiple times were forced yet again
to flee their homes, including in counties such as Leer, Koch,
Mayendit and Rubkona in Unity. By December, some 212,000
IDPs had sought refuge in UN PoC sites, the highest number
since the conflict began.
Children, the elderly, people with disabilities and people
living with HIV/AIDS have been particularly vulnerable
during displacement. More than 17,000 children,
primarily boys, have been recruited and are being used by
armed actors, including 1,300 children recruited in 2016.
There are high levels of family separation, with over 9,000
separated, unaccompanied and missing children registered by
humanitarian partners as at November 2016, and the actual
number expected to be much higher. Many families report
having had to abandon young children, aged and infirm family
members when fleeing fighting. Violence and displacement in
the Greater Equatoria region have affected populations with the
highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS in South Sudan, cutting
many off from their life-sustaining treatment. Despite the best
efforts of humanitarians, conditions in the PoC sites continue
to be below minimum humanitarian standards, and people
seeking safety in the sites continue to face restrictions on their
ability to move freely. At least 1,000 people with disabilities
have been registered in camp- or camp-like settings, and it is
estimated that some 200,000 to 250,000 people with disabilities
are displaced overall.7
Over the course of 2016, the protective environment for
refugees inside South Sudan deteriorated. All refugees
are hosted in the conflict-affected states of Greater Upper
Nile and Greater Equatoria. Ezo camp in Western Equatoria
was formally closed in February 2016 due to insecurity, and
humanitarian access to Lasu camp in Central Equatoria has
become extremely difficult due to deteriorating security in
the area since July 2016. Most refugees left the camp seeking
safety in the bush and a number of Congolese refugees have

returned to DRC under duress. Meanwhile, in 2016, some
10,000 refugees arrived into South Sudan from South Kordofan
in Sudan. The number of refugees hosted in South Sudan from Sudan, DRC, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic
(CAR) - in need of international protection and multi-sectorial
humanitarian assistance was 263,000 in November 2016. It
is estimated that, by the end of 2017, the refugee population
will rise to more than 302,800 due both ongoing new arrivals projected to be around 15,000 - and natural growth.
Three years of war have taken a major psychological toll on
the population. An estimated 1 million children are believed
to be in psychosocial distress, and a 2016 report by Amnesty
International found that IDPs described experiencing a
range of symptoms commonly associated with mental health
disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and depression.8 This aligns with a study completed in July
2015 which found that 41 per cent of respondents showed
symptoms of PTSD.9 The World Health Organization (WHO)
estimates that in situations of armed conflict and other
emergencies, the proportion of the population suffering from
mild or moderate mental disorders rises from approximately
10 per cent to 15-20 per cent.10 In a live discussion on Kapoeta
Sangaita FM to feed into the HNO, several community
members highlighted the need for counselling and mental
health care for the full recovery of the local population and
meaningful peace-building to take place. There are only
two psychiatrists, one psychiatric nurse, 30 psychologists
and 20 community mental health workers in all of South
Sudan, meaning that the country has only one mental health
professional for every 220,000 people, less than half of the
recommended minimum (one per 100,000 people).11

“The first priority that I need is food.
Let food first reach the population
because when you’re satisfied, you can
think well. You can even think of taking
children to school or to the hospital.
But when I am hungry, I will not even
think about education or health of the
children but I will only be thinking of
when I will eat. That is why I need food
to be the first priority.”
- a community member participating in the
Kapoeta Sangaita FM live discussion for the HNO
In 2017, food security in South Sudan is likely to deteriorate
even further, with an unprecedented number of people
facing severe food insecurity and thousands of people at
risk of famine in conflict-affected areas where access to
markets has been compromised and in areas hardest hit by

the economic crisis. At the height of the lean season in July
2016, some 4.8 million people – more than one in three people
in South Sudan – were estimated to be severely food insecure.
This number is projected to rise as high as five million in
2017 due to the impact of the spreading conflict, deepening
economic crisis and climatic events in several regions in 2016.
Even following seasonal harvests in 2016, partners estimated
that some 3.7 million people were food insecure in October representing an increase of one million people compared to the
same period last year – and food security experts warned that
the benefits of the harvest would be short-lived.12 The coping
mechanisms of vulnerable households have been totally eroded
and there is a risk of severe food security consequences if the
cereal deficit is not met in the coming months- particularly
through the lean season of 2017.

economic crisis, market failure and the loss or depletion of
livelihood assets.14 The conflict has also impacted markets and
trade flow, particularly in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap
and across the Equatorias. In Unity, there are no functioning
markets in Koch, Mayendit or Leer. Livestock have been looted,
killed and exposed to increased risk of disease, including due to
irregular migration routes taken by cattle herders as a result of
the conflict. Women and the elderly continue to be particularly
impacted by the increasing food shortage, as households are
prioritizing food for children. Women are shouldering the
burden of foraging for wild foods that are increasingly depleted,
forcing them to travel longer and arduous distances by foot,
and exposing them to the risk of attacks or sexual violence. The
loss of protein sources more rapidly affects women, who are
more vulnerable to Vitamin A deficiency.

About 50 per cent of all harvests have been lost in areas
affected by violence, and many farmers have been unable
to plant or harvest due to insecurity and restrictions on
freedom of movement. The Greater Equatoria region,
which is responsible for over half of the country’s net cereal
production and the only surplus producing area, was severely
impacted by violence in the latter half of 2016, preventing many
households from accessing farms for first season harvests and
second season cultivation.13 A cereal deficit of more than 50
per cent was reported in 2016 and is likely to increase in 2017.
In Northern Bahr el Ghazal, assessment findings show that
farmers produced less in 2016 than in 2015, with some areas
being hard-hit by flooding and dry spells, in addition to the

More than one million children under age 5 and some
339,000 pregnant and lactating women are now estimated
to be acutely malnourished,15 with rates continuing to rise
due to conflict, displacement, food insecurity, disease, and
lack of access to clean water and good sanitation. SMART
surveys carried out during or after the lean season in 2016
showed a significant deterioration in the nutrition situation in
many areas compared to 2015. Thirty-two out of 44 SMART
surveys carried out in 2016 found global acute malnutrition
(GAM) rates above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent.
Of these, 13 found a GAM prevalence by weight-for-height
(WHZ) of more than 25 per cent. The GAM rate was above
the catastrophe threshold in Gogrial West County in Warrap

and Renk County in Upper Nile, (>30 per cent), and just
beneath it in Abiemnhom and Rubkona in Unity (29.2 per cent
GAM). Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are
nine times more likely to die than their healthy peers, while
those with moderate acute malnutrition are three times more
likely to die. As the South Sudan crisis enters its fourth year,
an increasing number of children are at high risk of chronic
malnutrition (two years or more), which leads to irreversible
cognitive impairments. The conflict has severely disrupted
families’ access to animal milk, which is a major source of
nutrition for children in cattle-keeping and agro-pastoralist
parts of the country.16 The need for milk for children was
highlighted by participants in focus group discussions for the
HNO in the Bor, Juba, Malakal and Bentiu PoC sites.

child. It’s what forces me to sell

South Sudan’s economic crisis has escalated, compounding
the plight of the country’s urban poor. In 2016, South
Sudan’s economy faced multiple major shocks, including the
eruption of conflict in Juba, and the drop in international oil

prices (which decreased from 49.79 USD/barrel in June to
46.06 USD/barrel in November 2016). This triggered a severe
fiscal and economic crisis, leading to “sky rocketing prices”,
according to the World Bank.17 The South Sudan annual
Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 835.7 per cent from
October 2015 to October 2016,18 the world’s highest year-onyear inflation rate. The exchange rate for the South Sudanese
Pound (SSP) to the US Dollar has rapidly depreciated, halving
between June (46 SSP/USD) and November (>100 SSP/USD)
2016. The prices of staple foods, such as sorghum, maize and
beans, are at record highs, with the price of sorghum in Juba
596 per cent higher in October 2016 compared to October
2015 and 1,177 per cent above the five-year average. The
purchasing power of households across the country has been
eroded, particularly in the market-reliant Greater Bahr elGhazal region. By September 2016, 51 per cent of households
in Juba were food insecure, up from 23 per cent at the same
time in 2015, and by October 2016, the World Bank estimated
that some 66 per cent of South Sudan’s population was living
in poverty.19 Reports indicate that people are increasingly
resorting to negative coping mechanisms, including child
labour and child marriage. In Eastern Equatoria, child
marriages are reported to have increased in late 2016 as
families receive a bride price in exchange for their daughter.20
Intimate partner violence, which often rises during
conflict and economic decline, accounts for 48 per cent
of the incidents of gender-based violence reported to
humanitarian partners.21

Impacts of multiple & deepening crises

With the spread of conflict and the deepening of the
economic crisis, civilian infrastructure has been damaged,
destroyed and shut down in an increasing number of
locations. Throughout the conflict, humanitarian compounds
and supplies have been attacked and looted, including
in Juba, Leer, Nhiladiu, Malakal, Mundri and Pibor in
2016. From 1 January to 28 November 2016, there were 64
reported incidents of looting of humanitarian facilities and
assets across 32 counties. Only 43 per cent of the country’s
health facilities (595 out of 1,384) have remained functional,
providing extremely minimal services in the face of a
chronic lack of essential medicines, limited funding and high
operational costs. Some 190 health facilities have been directly
affected by conflict, with 106 closed and at least 29 looted or
destroyed since December 2013. Education infrastructure has
also been dramatically impacted by violence. It is estimated
that more than 1.17 million children have lost access to
education due to conflict and displacement. A representative
survey undertaken in November 2016 found that around
25 per cent of primary schools in South Sudan are closed,
primarily due to insecurity and displacement of teachers and
students. The survey also found widespread attacks against
schools. Some 31 per cent of open schools had been subjected
to at least one attack since December 2013, with schools in the
Greater Upper Nile most affected. Almost 16 per cent of the
open schools had been hit by bullets, and around 10 per cent
had seen occupation of classrooms by armed actors. Over 34
per cent of the open schools reported having endured theft or
looting at least one time since December 2013.
The conflict has littered vast swathes of land, access routes
and buildings with unexploded ordnance that threaten
the safety of individuals, communities and humanitarian
actors. In nearly 71 per cent of counties (56 out of 79),
extensive routes are known to be contaminated by explosive
remnants of war, rendering over 300 schools and 30 clinics
unsafe for use. Approximately 170 new hazards are found
each month.

“I want organizations to help the local
residents to open the schools for the
children of the vulnerable people
because some of the children are
now on the streets and they will not
have good future if they aren’t taken
to school.”
- a community member speaking with
Mayardit FM in Turalei, Warrap, during the
HNO consultations
Access to safe water remains a challenge, and water-borne
diseases have spread due to displacement. It is estimated
that only seven per cent of South Sudanese people have access
to improved sanitation and only 41 per cent have access
to safe water. As the conflict spread to new areas in 2016,
access to safe water and sanitation was impacted. Boreholes
were damaged or made dysfunctional due to lack of repairs.
Across 16 locations assessed through Initial Rapid Needs
Assessments (IRNAs) in 2016, only 42 per cent of hand
pumps (69 out of 161) were functional at the time of the
IRNA.24 In locations where no hand pump was functioning,
people reported using streams or ponds as their main

Civilians’ homes, crops and assets have been targeted,
destroyed, damaged and looted during the fighting. In
Leer, civilians have reported that, in addition to stealing
cattle, destroying tools and crops, and permanently damaging
civilian infrastructure, attackers systematically cut down or
burned mango trees to remove any natural source of food or
livelihood.22 In and around Wau town, some 1,500 houses
were reportedly looted or burned between December 2015
and March 2016.23

water source, including in Bangolo (Mundri West), Lozoh
(Mundri East) and most locations in Yambio and Gangura
payams. Lack of access to safe water and sanitation both pose
protection risks for women, with the search to find a safe
place to defecate and the trek to collect water leaving women
exposed to the threat of violence. For the third year in a row,
the Government declared a cholera epidemic in 2016 and, as
of 1 December, more than 3,100 cholera cases, including 44
deaths, had been reported across nine counties. Communities
along the River Nile have been worst affected and account for
91 per cent of reported cholera cases in 2016.

“People are suffering. During the dry
season some villages do not have
enough hand pumps and that forced
some residents to drink from the river.
This unclean water brings disease to
the people.”
- a community member speaking with
Mayardit FM in Turalei, Warrap, during the
HNO consultations
Three years of conflict, displacement and economic
decline have made the population more susceptible to
communicable diseases. From 1 January to 13 November
2016, more than 2 million cases of malaria were reported in
health facilities, including more than 476 deaths. Since the
beginning of 2016, 1,851 suspected measles cases including
at least 19 deaths (Case Fatality Rate 1.03 per cent) have been
reported, with 13 counties confirming outbreaks - Lakes
(Yirol West), Northern Bahr el Ghazal (Aweil Central, Aweil
North, Aweil West), Western Bahr el Ghazal (Wau), Unity
(Leer, Mayendit, Mayom, Rubokna), Warrap (Gogril West,
Twic), Upper Nile (Malakal PoC) and Central Equatoria (Juba
PoC 3, Mangaten) – in addition to the disputed Abyei Area.

education

There have been more than 3,600 cases of the deadly tropical
disease kala-azar, including 88 deaths (CFR 2.4 per cent).
These figures represent only the number of cases and deaths
reported at health facilities. With health facility reporting
rates below 50 per cent, the real prevalence of disease and
level of morbidity are likely to be significantly higher.
Conflict, displacement and lack of access have frustrated
efforts to ensure vaccination coverage with the disruption of
routine immunization. While there have been improvements
over the past year, only 11 out of South Sudan’s 79 counties
have the requisite minimum 80 per cent measles vaccination
coverage and 26 have less than 20 per cent coverage. An
estimated 648,000 children under age 5 are at risk of
contracting measles across the country.
Access to information regarding the situation and the
humanitarian response remains a major need. At least
42 per cent of the population in South Sudan report not
being able to access/use any media type inside the home
or elsewhere.25 Radio and word of mouth remain the most
common methods of communication, with word of mouth
continuing to be the most trusted source of information. In
consultations for the preparation of the HNO, community
members indicated that they still often do not feel like they
receive the information that they need to take decisions as
well as to inform the humanitarian response. In the Malakal
PoC and Malakal town, 20 per cent of people consulted in
focus group discussions for the HNO highlighted information
as a priority need (a higher percentage than any other need).

“I cannot imagine life in the PoC
without information about what is
going on in the PoC. Nile FM helped
me to know what NGOs are doing.”

group in Malakal PoC during the HNO

Overview

No. of people in need

An estimated 630,600 individuals will
require direct Camp Coordination and Camp
Management (CCCM) Cluster services in 2017.
This includes nearly 400,000 internally displaced
people (IDPs) living in camps or camp-like settings, including
212,000 in UNMISS Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites, more
than 159,700 in informal settlements, and more than 28,100
in collective centres. In addition, more than 82,400 host
community individuals and 148,600 IDPs residing in areas
nearby camp and camp-like settings are in need of CCCM
services, particularly to ensure information-flow between
populations inside and outside the camps. An estimated
302,800 refugees will be in need of CCCM services by the
end of 2017.

As of the end of 2016, nearly 400,000 people are living
in camp or camp-like settings, with a further 1.4 million
displaced outside camps. Renewed conflict in 2016 caused
new displacement, generating an influx into existing sites,
and requiring the creation of new camps and collective
centres – including in locations previously not hosting mass
displacement sites. Fighting in June and July in Wau and Juba
resulted in thousands of people seeking physical protection

Displaced people in camps and camp-like settings are in
greatest need of CCCM services. Women and girls continue to
be particularly vulnerable and face the risk of sexual violence
both inside displacement sites and when collecting fuel or
food in surrounding areas. At the beginning of 2016, the
majority of displaced people in camp and camp-like settings
were located in the Greater Upper Nile. However, following
conflict in Wau in Western Bahr el Ghazal and Juba in Central
Equatoria over the course of the year, the number of people in
camp and camp-like settings in these areas increased.

in UNMISS bases, and church and NGO compounds. A new
protected site and five collective centres were established in
Wau in 2016, jointly hosting over 42,000 IDPs.
Despite efforts in the first half of 2016 to support IDPs’ choices
to undertake safe, dignified, voluntary and informed return,
resettlement or reintegration, returns slowed following the
upswing in fighting in the latter half of the year. By December,
some 212,000 were sheltering in PoC sites – an increase of
20,000 over the same period in 2015. IDPs continue to state
security as the primary driver of their decision to remain inside
the PoCs. Despite investments to upgrade and maintain the
sites, overcrowding continues to be of significant health, security
and protection concern. The population in the Wau protective
site lives in less than 5.5m2 space per person – one sixth of the
Sphere standard. Overcrowding poses stress and mental
health concerns for the population and increases protection
risks, particularly for women and girls.

Overview

No. of people in need

Since conflict erupted in December 2013, some
1.17 million26 children aged 3 to 18 years have lost
access to education. The Primary Net Enrolment
rate is now 43.5 per cent, due to conflict,
displacement, lack of trained teachers, inadequate supplies,
and disruption of education services fuelled by the economic
crisis. In addition, some 124,100 refugee children in South
Sudan will be in need of education assistance in 2017.

South Sudanese school-aged children (3 to 18 years old)
have been endangered and had their education disrupted by
conflict and displacement. Adolescent boys and young men
are particularly vulnerable to recruitment by armed actors. At
the same time, adolescent girls are at increasing risk of early
and forced marriage, as well as sexual abuse and exploitation,
due to the escalating economic crisis. Reported incidents of
possible sexual slavery more than tripled during July 2016,
while reported incidents of forced marriages doubled.27 While
risks to disruption of children’s education were highest in
Greater Upper Nile at the beginning of 2016, over the course
of the year risks increased in Greater Equatoria and Greater
Bahr el Ghazal, where conflict escalated and the economic
crisis hit hard.

Humanitarian Needs & Drivers
Some 1.17 million children have lost access to education due
to the crisis in South Sudan. School-aged children represent
more than 47.75 per cent of the displaced population.
Education infrastructure has also been dramatically impacted
by violence. A representative survey undertaken in November
2016 found that around 25 per cent of primary schools in
South Sudan are closed, primarily due to insecurity and
displacement of teachers and students. The survey also found
widespread attacks against schools. Some 31 per cent of
open schools had been subjected to at least one attack since

December 2013, with schools in the Greater Upper Nile most
affected. Almost 16 per cent of the open schools had been
hit by bullets, and around 10 per cent had seen occupation
of classrooms by armed actors. Over 34 per cent of the open
schools reported having endured theft or looting at least one
time since December 2013.
This interruption of education will have immediate, medium
and long term consequences for the stability and development
of South Sudan, as children who are not in school will lack
the structure and stimulation for healthy cognitive and
psychosocial development. Furthermore, the education
crisis increases the risk that more out-of-school adolescents
will be recruited by armed actors. Children, parents and the
communities consider education a critical priority.

Emergency shelter and nfis
No. of people in need by status

Overview
There are now nearly 1.9 million IDPs in South
Sudan, many of whom have been displaced
multiple times. An estimated 1.6 million people will
be in need of some sort of emergency shelter and/
or non-food item (NFI) support in 2017. This includes the vast
majority of IDPs living in PoCs and spontaneous settlements
– around 250,000 people – who will require new shelters or
reinforcement of existing infrastructure, and at least 1.15 million
IDPs outside PoCs who will require NFIs. In addition, some
302,800 refugees are expected to need shelter and NFIs in 2017.

The displaced – particularly those whose homes have
been destroyed, damaged or looted - are most in need of
emergency shelter and NFIs. Although the conflict continues
to shift and evolve, IDPs in Unity, Western Bahr el Ghazal
and Greater Equatoria are currently most in need. Of the
displaced, women and children remain especially vulnerable
both due to their roles in society and the protection risks
inherent in being without shelter or social support networks.
A small number of host community members are also in need
of assistance as they have used their own limited resources to
provide for the displaced.

Humanitarian Needs & Drivers
Forced displacement remains a defining feature of the South
Sudan crisis. Many people have been displaced multiple
times, including in locations such as Leer, Koch and Mayendit
in Unity, where people who fled fighting during the major
offensive in 2015 were forced to again flee for safety during
clashes in 2016. Others, particularly in the Equatorias,
were displaced for the first time since the conflict began
over the course of 2016. At the same time, people who have
sought shelter in the PoC sites are unlikely to leave given the
continued insecurity in their places of origin and eruption of
fighting in new locations.

Targeting of civilians’ homes, crops and assets has been
common during the fighting. In Leer, civilians have reported
that attackers have stolen cattle, destroyed tools and crops,
and permanently damaged civilian infrastructure.28 Based on
research carried out with key informants with knowledge of
the situation in some 232 villages in the Greater Equatoria
region and 278 villages in Unity, 50 to 100 per cent of homes
are reported to have been damaged or destroyed in some
32 villages in Greater Equatoria and 110 villages in Unity.29
Civilians are often forced to flee with nothing but the
clothes on the backs, leaving behind vital household items
like blankets, mats and mosquito nets. Looting of homes is
reported when fighting takes places.
Emergency shelter and NFI assistance is critical to ensuring
the health, safety and dignity of South Sudan’s most conflictaffected populations.

food security and livelihoods
Overview

No. of people in need

In 2017, food security in South Sudan is likely
to deteriorate to unprecedented levels, with
thousands of people at risk of famine. At the
height of the lean season in July 2016, some 4.8
million people – more than one in every three people in
South Sudan – were estimated to be severely food insecure.
In the last quarter of 2016 and following the harvest, partners
estimated that some 3.7 million people were food insecure representing an increase of one million people compared to
the same period in 2015 – and food security experts warned
that the benefits of the harvest would be short-lived.30 It is
projected that more than five million people will be in urgent
need of food security and livelihoods support during the lean
season in 2017. This includes some 302,800 refugees in South
Sudan.

in purchasing power, reduced trade flows, decreasing
agricultural production and expanding insecurity, making
the food security situation highly precarious. Negative
coping strategies have been adopted by the majority of the
population, particularly reducing the number of meals
consumed (89 per cent), reducing adult consumption (74 per
cent), relying on wild food (70 per cent) and spending a day
without food (58 per cent).32
Livelihoods have been decimated by the crisis. About 50 per
cent of all harvests have been lost in areas affected by violence,
and many farmers have been unable to plant or harvest due to
insecurity and restrictions on freedom of movement. A cereal
deficit of some 50 per cent was reported in 2016 and is likely to
increase in 2017. Livestock have been looted, killed and exposed
to increased risk of disease, including due to irregular migration
routes taken by cattle herders as a result of the conflict.

As the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan has deepened
and expanded, food insecurity has risen to unprecedented
levels due to a combination of conflict, insecurity, low cereal
production, severe economic crisis, and the exhaustion
of coping capacities after three years of crisis. These
multiple and interlocking threats have caused a decline

Conflict-affected and displaced households are facing

in the Greater Equatoria region –South Sudan’s breadbasketthat have been cut-off from planting and harvesting their
crops due to conflict in 2016. In addition, the rapidly
escalating economic crisis has increased food insecurity,
particularly for populations who depend on markets as a food
resource such as in Northern Bahr el Ghazal and other urban
areas. Female-headed households are significantly more likely
to be food insecure and to have a malnourished child than
male-headed households.31

Overview

No. of people in need

More than five million people in South Sudan are
in need of humanitarian healthcare services. After
three years of conflict, the population is highly
susceptible to disease. Most health facilities are
not functioning and those that are provide minimal services
due to drug and staff shortages. Communicable diseases have
spread in 2016, including cholera which has reached new
locations along the River Nile, and there is a growing number
of war wounded. Some 302,800 refugees will also require
health assistance in 2017.

The conflict has taken a major toll on people’s ability to access
healthcare, which was exacerbated following the eruption of
fighting in Juba in July and the spread of conflict to new locations in the latter half of the year. At least one in ten health
facilities have been affected by the conflict, including being
targeted, destroyed, damaged and occupied. It is estimated
that a maximum of 43 per cent of the country’s 1,384 health
facilities have remained operational. Even those that are open

ed funding and high operational costs. Some 80 per cent of
health care services in South Sudan are managed by NGOs,
with continuity of services reliant upon funding. A vital
development project that funded healthcare in Jonglei and
Upper Nile was placed on hold as a result of the conflict in
July, with major consequences for healthcare provision across
large swathes of territory.
South Sudan faces highly endemic communicable diseases,
with persistent outbreaks of cholera, measles, malaria, hepatitis E and kala-azar affecting large parts of the country due
to poor living conditions, poor sanitation and overcrowding.
Malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia are the top reasons of
outpatient consultations. The coverage for all vaccine preventable diseases remains below 50 per cent, and is less than 20
per cent in Unity, Jonglei and Upper Nile. In 2016, 648,000
children under age 5 are estimated to be at risk of measles.

Displaced people face the most complex challenges in
accessing health care; particularly those who have fled to
remote locations. Children under age 5 are particularly
vulnerable to disease, including due to the low level of routine
immunization and their already weakened state. Women face
serious health risks throughout their life cycle. Survivors of
gender-based violence have inadequate access to services and
women have inadequate access to skilled personnel during
pregnancy and childbirth. As the conflict has spread and the
economic crisis has deepened, people with HIV/AIDS or TB
have become cut-off from life-saving treatment, particularly
in the Greater Equatoria region.

The nutrition crisis in South Sudan continues to
escalate. More than one million children under age
5 and over 339,000 pregnant and lactating women
are estimated to be acutely malnourished and in
need of life-saving nutrition services. In 2016, nearly 73 per
cent (32 out of 44) of the SMART surveys conducted reported
global acute malnutrition (GAM) levels above the emergency
threshold of 15 per cent. Of these, 13 found a GAM prevalence
by Weight-for-Height (WHZ) of more than 25 per cent. The
GAM rate was above the catastrophe threshold in Gogrial West
in Warrap and Renk in Upper Nile (>30 per cent), and just
beneath it in Abiemnhom and Rubkona in Unity (29.2 per cent
GAM). In addition, some 302,800 refugees are expected to need

South Sudan faces a chronic nutrition crisis driven by a number of inter-related factors, including: rising food insecurity;
high morbidity rates; limited access to safe water and sanitation; and declining availability of health services. The level of
acute malnutrition has risen significantly in 2016, with the
Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS)

indicating a consistent deterioration of the nutrition situation
over the last three years. In Western Bahr el Ghazal, the GAM
rate jumped from 12.1 per cent in July 2015 to 20.6 per cent

and economic decline have severely impacted the provision of
life-saving nutrition services.
Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are nine
times more likely to die than their healthy peers, while those
with moderate acute malnutrition are three times more likely to
die. Undernourished children who survive may become locked
in a cycle of recurring illness and faltering growth, with irreversible damage to their development and cognitive abilities.

protection
Overview

No. of people in need by Status

South Sudan is first and foremost a protection
crisis. Since 2013, the population has been exposed
to repeated deliberate attacks on civilians and
other violations of international humanitarian and
human rights law, including forced recruitment of children and
deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure. Government
soldiers, opposition militia, armed groups and criminals all
act with complete disregard for the rule of law. While some
IDPs have found relative refuge in PoC sites, they represent
a small proportion of the population affected by the crisis.
Even those who have reached the PoC sites face risks: women
and girls continue to be exposed to sexual violence inside the
PoC sites and when they attempt to gather firewood and food
outside, IDPs experience psychosocial distress as a result of
violence, displacement, confinement in PoC sites, and real
and potential attacks on the PoC sites and their communities.
Despite attempts by humanitarians, services in the PoC sites do
not meet minimum humanitarian standards. In addition, some
302,800 refugees will need protection in 2017.

Affected People
All segments of the population are exposed to protection risks.
Women and girls have been disproportionately affected by
gender-based violence, with uniformed soldiers often reported
to be the perpetrators. Men and boys face high risks of forced
recruitment, as well as the threat of being detained or killed if
they are perceived to be of fighting age. Elderly and disabled
persons are often unable to flee in advance of fighting, and
face increased challenges in accessing services. Without a safe
environment, children are particularly vulnerable to abuse,
neglect, recruitment and psychological trauma.

Humanitarian Needs & Drivers
The eruption of fighting in Juba in July 2016 highlighted the
fragility of the protection environment in South Sudan. The
outbreak of violence plunged civilians back into a state of
uncertainty, and further compounded their already desperate

civilians. Impunity reigns with no accountability mechanism
in place to help end the violence. Sexual and gender-based
violence is endemic, and urgent action is needed to prevent
these incidents and provide timely and holistic support to
survivors. Forced recruitment continues to be a common
practice, necessitating a comprehensive approach to identifying,
releasing and reintegrating children associated with armed
groups. Over 1 million children are believed to be in need of
psychosocial support. Fifty-six counties and extensive routes
are contaminated by explosive remnants of war. Such hazards
currently render over 300 schools and 30 clinics unsafe for use.

diminished as a result of rapidly rising prices due to inflation.
Some 302,800 refugees will also need WASH services in 2017.

Humanitarian Needs & Drivers
The conflict in South Sudan has compounded the WASH needs
of an already vulnerable population. It is estimated that only 7
per cent of the population have access to improved sanitation,
while 74 per cent of the population practices open defecation
(50 per cent in urban areas and 79 per cent in rural areas).
The main drivers of vulnerabilities related to WASH are
closely linked to the conflict. In conflict-affected areas
existing WASH services outside PoC sites are inadequate

to address the needs of IDPs and host communities and
have been further overstretched by new arrivals. WASH
out of
infrastructure has been deliberately targeted by armed actors
people are food insecure
during the conflict. In surveys, it was reported that in 113
out of 296 villages covered in the Greater Equatoria region,
and in 192 out of 424 villages covered in Unity, there were no
functioning boreholes.36 In locations where no hand pump
was functioning, people reported using streams or ponds as
their main water source.
The lack of WASH investment in urban areas has resulted
in a worsening public health crisis leading to yearly cholera
outbreaks, including in the capital city, Juba. Water-borne
disease have spread due to displacement and overcrowding.
Over the past year, there has been a dramatic rise in the cost
of safe water for urban residents. High malnutrition rates are
also strongly linked to poor WASH conditions.

IDPs outside PoC sites and in areas that have remained largely
inaccessible due to the conflict – particularly in Unity and
Upper Nile - have the highest WASH needs. In the PoCs,
people are living in overcrowded conditions and require
ongoing WASH assistance to prevent further outbreaks of
water-borne and water-related disease. There are also people
in urban areas who are vulnerable to outbreaks due to lack
of access to safe water, including due to rising prices. Flood
plain areas along the River Nile remain at high risk of waterborne and water-related disease. Lack of access to safe water
and sanitation pose specific protection risks for women. The
search to find a safe place to defecate and the trek to collect
water expose women to the threat of violence.

information and INFRASTRUCTURE

information and INFRASTRUCTURE
Overview
South Sudan remains one of the most logistically challenging
places in the world and has one of the most underdeveloped
communications technology infrastructures. The severely
under-developed and under-maintained roads have continued
to deteriorate over the past year. Some 60 per cent of the
country becomes inaccessible by road during the rainy
season, which usually lasts from June to December. In a
country of approximately 650,000 km2, there is only one
sealed international road, the 192km stretch between JubaNimule on the Ugandan border. The majority of river ports
are in poor condition, resulting in significant delays with
loading and offloading. Many ports do not have the heavy
equipment required to offload heavy/bulky items. At the same
time, insecurity and conflict continue to impede the ability to
move along key road routes. Major supply routes through the
Western corridor, which have historically been more stable,
are now affected by fighting and physical access constraints.
The underdeveloped infrastructure, lack of road maintenance,
long rainy season, and disruption of key road routes due to

conflict have left the humanitarian community with limited
options to deliver life-saving cargo to people in dire need
around the country, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. Prepositioning in deep field locations continues to be minimal
for many organizations due to insecurity and the risk of
having supplies looted. Many humanitarian organizations
therefore rely extensively on air operations to deliver their
programmes, the cost of which can be up to eight times more
than if the supplies could be transported by road.
Access to media across South Sudan remains limited, with
at least 42 per cent of the population reporting that they
do not have access to any media type inside the home or
elsewhere.38 The most accessed media are radio (52 per
cent) and mobile phones (40 per cent). However, traditional,
face-to-face methods of information-sharing remain more
trusted than mass communications. The spread of conflict to
new locations has made communicating with communities
even more challenging, with telecommunications and radio
infrastructure vandalized, destroyed and disrupted, including
due to shortages of fuel.

Methodology and information gaps

methodology and information gaps

The challenge of providing concrete data in South Sudan is
well known. The last census of the area was conducted in 2008
and all population data since that time has been based on
projections. While these projections may have been partially
reliable prior to the conflict, the degree of displacement and
mortality during the conflict has made it immensely difficult
to track the number of people in any given location. Another
challenge generated by the absence of accurate baseline data is
the scarcity of sex and age disaggregated data.
Over the past year, substantial progress has been made in
reviewing and revising displacement data, including through
the biometric registration of more than 120,600 people,
registration of nearly 53,800 people by other means, and
the establishment of a monthly meeting with participation
by IOM, OCHA, CCCM and Protection partners to review
displacement data across all counties and update figures with
the best available estimates. However, more remains to be
done in estimating the number of people remaining in each
county in the country following the massive refugee outflow
in the latter half of 2016.
For this Humanitarian Needs Overview, partners utilised
existing population projections, alongside available information
regarding displacement, including the counties of origin of
people who have fled the country as refugees and those who
have arrived at PoC sites, in order to attempt to determine
the number of people in need across the country. It is
recognised that there is a wide margin of possible error in these
calculations. However, they are the best available at this time.
The number of people in need for each sector was determined
on the basis of the following calculations:
CCCM: The number of people in need was calculated by
adding the number of people in camp and camp-like settings
to an estimated IDP and host community population in areas
immediately surrounding these sites.
Education: The number of people in need was calculated by
using two indicators for which data was collected during the
second term of the school year: 1) net enrolment rate; and 2)
closure of schools in Jonglei, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity,
Upper Nile, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Western Equatoria.
Emergency Shelter/Non-Food Items: The number of
people in need was calculated by reviewing all 2015 and
2016 assessments done by Emergency Shelter/NFI partners,
calculating the average percentage of people in need identified
by these assessments, and projecting it to the current affected
population. The Cluster determined that 100 per cent of the
population in PoCs, 88 per cent of the population outside
of PoCs, 2 per cent of the host community, 1.5 per cent of
returnees and 0.2 per cent of the population affected by
natural disasters will be in need of ES/NFI assistance for 2017.

Food Security and Livelihoods: Trends in the Integrated
Phase Classification (IPC) data from 2013-2016 were used
to project the number of people who will be food insecure
during the lean season in 2017.
Health: It is estimated that at least 44 per cent of the
population do not have access to health care services in South
Sudan. The number of people in need of emergency health
assistance was therefore calculated by taking 44 per cent of
the number of IDPs in host communities and in informal
settlements, and adding the full number of IDPs in PoC sites.
Nutrition: The nutrition caseload was estimated using
existing and latest global guidance on severe acute
malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition
(MAM) caseloads among children under age 5 and pregnant
and lactating women (PLW). The following elements were
used in estimating the caseload : a) under-five population
was taken as 19 per cent of the total population in a
county; b) county specific SAM and MAM prevalence;
and c) correction factor39 of 2.6 for both SAM and MAM
caseloads, summarized in the following equation: burden/
cases= under-five population x prevalence x 2.6. Prior to
2017, a correction factor of 1.5 was used in estimating MAM
caseloads. However, this was revised to 2.6 by the Global
Nutrition Cluster (GNC) over the course of 2016. As a result,
the under-five MAM caseload has increased considerably
compared to previous years (2015 and 2016). The PLW
caseload was estimated using the same elements and equation
except that PLW population was estimated at 8 per cent and
a correction factor of 1.5 was applied as per GNC guidance.
The prevalence of SAM and MAM among under-five children
were taken from county level SMART surveys conducted in
2016. In counties without SMART surveys, state-level Food
Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) Round
18 results were extrapolated at county level for the purpose of
estimating caseload and targets.
Protection: The Protection Cluster made the following
assumptions when calculating people in need:
• The entire IDP caseload (nearly 1.9 million) is in need of
some form of protection
• Vulnerable and at-risk members of host communities
(approx. 75 per cent of the total population) in locations
where IDPs constitute more than 15 per cent of the
population are in need of support, particularly to avoid
creating tensions between the IDP and host community
populations
• People in counties that are heavily affected by violence
(>40 casualties or >10 conflicts, as identified by ACLED)
or where there has been a new deterioration are in need of
protection

27

methodology and information gaps

In addition, there are some counties that require specific,
targeted interventions:

• Disease outbreaks: 60 per cent of people at risk of cholera in
2016 = 661,056

• Counties that have a high number of unaccompanied and
separated children (>100) are in need family tracing and
reunification (FTR)

• Nutrition: All counties with GAM rate equal to or greater
than 10 are in need for WASH Services = 1,354,438

• Counties with high levels of incidents of grave violations of
children’s rights are in need of protection
• Counties with high levels of mine/UXO contamination
(>5 hazards) are in need of protection though survey and
clearance activities
The result was the identification of 7.02 million South
Sudanese people across 58 counties who are in need of
humanitarian protection.
WASH: The methodology used to identify the most
vulnerable is based on the conflict affected, natural disasters,
outbreaks, food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the
country, as follows:
• Conflict affected population in the country (IDPs in and
outside POCs) = 1,87million
• Flood prone data (counted only high risk areas) = 200,871
• FSL data: Emergency and Catastrophe = 676,000

• Conflict affected (IDPs) + High Risk of (Flood Prone) +
Emergency of (FSL) + risk of disease + GAM rate >= 10=
4,769,620 (4.77 million)
Overall: The overall number of people in need was calculated
by reviewing the number of people in need by sector by
county and selecting the highest sectoral number in order
to reduce duplication. The refugee caseload was then added
to the total for each sector. Protection figures were excluded
from the calculations given that they include both direct and
indirect needs.
In 2016, InterNews and OCHA worked in partnership to
enable the largest possible number of affected people to
interact with the HNO and HRP processes. Through its
regular media work with communities, Internews was able to
reach over 400,000 IDPs across five states where humanitarian
aid is provided as part of the consultations, including through
79 listening groups, as well as live call-in programmes on
community radio stations over a two-week period.

The amount of available data improved in 2017, including
through: improvements in assessment methodology for the
Initial Rapid Needs Assessment; better cross-referencing and
complementarity between different data collection efforts
(including Biometric Registration, Village Assessment Survey,
Area of Knowledge data and IRNAs); expanded collection of
Crude Death Rate data through the SMART surveys led by
the Nutrition Cluster; and sector-specific surveys carried out

28 28

at cluster-level, such as the Education Cluster’s assessment
of school functionality in November 2016. However, there
continue to be gaps in the humanitarian community’s
knowledge regarding the needs across the country.
Humanitarian partners continue to work to further refine
population and displacement estimates in order to better
determine the location and number of people in need.
