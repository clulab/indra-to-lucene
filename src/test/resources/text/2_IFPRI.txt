ABSTRACT

South Sudan faces serious problems of food insecurity due to low per capita levels of domestic food
production, periodic droughts, widespread poverty, political unrest, and since late 2013, renewed armed
conflict. Agricultural productivity is low, and the country is highly dependent on private-sector imports of
cereals (maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice) from Uganda to supply domestic markets.
National household survey data indicate substantial diversity in consumption of cereals across
households, and our econometric estimates suggest highly price- and income-inelastic demand for the two
major cereals, sorghum and maize.
Drawing on a review of international experience and the constraints facing South Sudan, we
conclude that a national food security reserve (NFSR) system with a small national food security stock is
feasible for South Sudan. Cereal stocks would be kept mainly for targeted safety nets and emergency
distribution, and market interventions would be limited in scope, in keeping with a long-run goal of
market development. Nonetheless, even with a functioning NFSR, promotion of private-sector domestic
and import trade will remain crucial for ensuring adequate supplies of grain and food security.

1. INTRODUCTION
Since achieving independence in 2011, South Sudan has continued to face daunting problems of food
insecurity and civil conflict. In part, this is due to the country’s difficult physical environment, with low
levels of rainfall and fragile soils, which reduce agricultural productivity. The geography of the country,
lacking direct access to sea ports and major markets, also hinders trade. Perhaps most important, though,
is the legacy of three decades of civil war and violence (1983 to 2005) that resulted in approximately 2
million deaths, massive population displacement, and low levels of investment in infrastructure, economic
stagnation, and widespread poverty (Ormhaug 2009). The cessation of fighting following the signing of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army permitted
a partial economic recovery. Recent unrest (December 2013 to present), however, threatens the lives and
food security of several million people as well as the economic development of South Sudan.
Emergency food aid has long been a major component of the food supply and a centerpiece of
national and donor strategy to address food insecurity in South Sudan. In 2011, food aid flows averaged
21 thousand metric tons; 1 but jumped to 109 thousand tons in 2012 (WFP 2013a). Imports from Uganda
have also been a crucial part of the food supply, helping South Sudan work toward food security. Privatesector imports of maize from Uganda added 353 thousand tons to national cereal availability in 2013 and
accounted for most of the cereal supply of the capital, Juba.
There are currently no large-scale public food stocks, however. Under the national government of
a united Sudan, the provincial government of South Sudan created a national food security stock of
sorghum in 2008 in anticipation of expected widespread food shortages (WFP 2013b). However, largescale and widespread misuse of funds led to the cancellation of donor support for the endeavor in 2009
and a loss of more than US$4 billion (Holland 2012). 2 Since then, the independent government of South
Sudan has demonstrated renewed interest in creating a national food stock as part of a national food
security reserve (NFSR) system. Under such a system, a national stock, supplied initially by food aid but
ultimately by domestic procurement of cereals, would provision emergency relief and targeted safety net
operations.
This report examines the role of public food stocks (mainly in the form of cereals) and privatesector cereal imports in increasing the availability of food and enabling targeted distribution to foodinsecure households. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the recent history of the country and of South
Sudan’s agricultural economy. Section 3 describes food production and consumption patterns, and
includes estimates of imports that highlight their importance in total cereal availability, particularly for
the capital, Juba. Section 4 presents an overview of the agriculture value chain and market institutions as
well as an analysis of domestic and border price movements of maize and sorghum. A potential NFSR
system is outlined in Section 5, followed by a summary of the major findings and policy implications in
the last section.

2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL
ECONOMY OF SOUTH SUDAN
Historical Background
South Sudan’s food security issues are linked to its troubled history of two civil wars that raged for more
than three decades. Six years after Sudan’s independence in 1956, a civil war broke out between the
North and southern rebels fighting for independence. This first war ended in 1972 with the Addis Ababa
Agreement, which granted southern Sudan a semiautonomous regional government (Arnold and LeRiche
2012). The settlement, which permitted a decade of political stability, eventually collapsed in 1983. A
second civil war ensued and continued until the signing of the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace
Agreement, which determined there would be a referendum on self-determination for the South in six
years (ICG 2005). In January 2011, the self-determination referendum resulted in an overwhelming vote
for independence, and on July 9, 2011, South Sudan became the world’s newest country (Table 2.1).

Despite its achievement of a peaceful independence, South Sudan remains one of the poorest
countries in the world, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of only US$1,045 (US$1,965 at
purchasing power parity) in 2013 and a life expectancy of 55.2 years, broadly similar to those of its
neighbors, Ethiopia and Uganda (Table 2.3). However, the new nation has been faced with continued
political tension from the North as well as from its own political elite. In 2012, disagreements over the
control of oil fields and petroleum export revenues led to boundary disputes between Sudan and South
Sudan. These unsolved issues resulted in the shutdown of oil refineries in 2012 and the closure of borders
with Sudan in the same year. In 2013, despite the resumption of oil production, a fresh dispute over oil
resources between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar led to the start of civil
2

war (Table 2.2). As of April 2015, more than 2 million people had been displaced from their homes, more
than 1.5 million became internally displaced persons inside South Sudan, and more than 500,000 became
refugees in neighboring countries (United Nations Security Council 2015).

Agriculture and the South Sudan Economy
The conflict has further limited infrastructure development and institutional growth, and worsened South
Sudan’s macroeconomic position. This has in turn resulted in significant constraints on agricultural
productivity and on food security. South Sudan is one of the least developed countries in the world, with a
GDP of current US$13.07 billion (Table 2.3). South Sudan’s economy is centered on oil production and
subsistence agriculture; almost all intermediate and consumer goods are imported. In 2013, oil production
accounted for about one-half of GDP, 99 percent of exports, and 95 percent of government revenue (IMF
2014).

The Macroeconomy and Foreign Trade
Prior to independence, between 2005 and 2011, government spending was around US$2.5 billion per
year, funded in large part by oil-related inflows. In the first few years after independence, government
spending continued at the same pace: from 2011/2012 to 2013/2014, it averaged US$2.06 billion (Table
2.4 and Figure 2.1). The effectiveness of government spending, however, was limited by poor budget
execution and governance problems. Moreover, the oil shutdown in 2012 seriously worsened the fiscal
accounts. As a result of the crisis, authorities were forced to cut expenditures by about 40 percent in real
terms in 2012/2013 and fund the budget with government deposits and short-term domestic and external
borrowing (IMF 2014). Since that time, South Sudan has continued to face fiscal pressures due to a fall in
oil production and the recent decline in international oil prices (Table 2.4 and Figure 2.1).

The increase in government spending after independence and the monetization of the deficit as a
result of the oil production stoppage pushed inflation to about 80 percent by mid-2012 (World Bank
2012b). Thereafter, lower food prices and fiscal austerity brought inflation down to near zero by mid2013 (Table 2.4). As the fiscal situation worsened again in 2014, however, shortfalls in revenues and in
external financing led to a monetary expansion that brought inflation to 11.24 percent in 2013/2014 (IMF
2014).
South Sudan introduced its currency, the South Sudanese pound (SSP), when it gained
independence in July 2011. In September, the Bank of South Sudan pegged the exchange rate at 2.95 SSP
per US dollar (Table 2.4). Since September 2011, rationing of foreign exchange has led to the
development of a parallel market where the currency trades at a premium compared with the official
exchange rate. A significant portion of goods are imported at the parallel market exchange rate, while
only a small number of transactions, including the imports of some foods, are paid for from foreign
exchange acquired at the official exchange rate (IMF 2014).

The official real effective exchange rate depreciated after independence in fiscal year 2011/2012
and has continued to decrease since then. However, if oil export earnings reach their potential, careful
macroeconomic management will be required to avoid a real exchange rate appreciation—an increase in
the price of tradable goods relative to the price of nontraded domestic goods. (This real exchange rate
appreciation would make imports of sorghum, maize and other cereals less expensive in real terms and
encourage an increase in imports.) Without any major domestic investments that increase productivity,
the profitability of production of tradable goods, including major agricultural products such as sorghum
and maize, will decline, an effect known as the Dutch disease.3 Moreover, the physical geography of
South Sudan makes foreign trade difficult. South Sudan is landlocked, with its nearest major ports—Port
of Sudan and Port of Mombasa, Kenya—as far as 2,650 and 1,639 km, respectively, from Juba by road.
As a result, transport and marketing costs are high, significantly increasing the total cost of imports and
reducing the prospect for exports.

South Sudan’s principal trading partner is Uganda (Table 2.5). Customs officials believe that 80
percent of all goods imported into South Sudan enter through the Nimule-Torit-Juba route (WFP 2015).
Trade with Sudan, South Sudan’s second most important trading partner, has decreased significantly since
independence. Trade between the two countries now is mainly informal. Most food from Sudan is
transported from El Obeid to Aweil. Before the separation of the two countries, northern Sudan was a key
provider of both food and fuel for southern Sudan. However, in 2012 the border was closed and supply
was cut off (World Bank 2014). Since 2013 some borders have been reopened, but trade has been slow to
recover. Kenya’s trade with South Sudan is mainly in nonfood items. Ethiopia also trades with South
Sudan, and in opposition-controlled areas, trade is now almost entirely with Ethiopia.

The Agricultural Sector
Although about 70 percent of total land area is suitable for cultivation in South Sudan, only 4 percent of
the land is currently used for agriculture (Diao et al. 2011, Figure 2.1). Thus, there is ample scope for
expansion of area cultivated. Currently, most crop cultivation is done on small farms, producing little if
any marketable surplus. According to estimates for 2013 from the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), 10 percent of the population of South
Sudan (about 1 million people) are severely food insecure (FAO and WFP 2013).
Rainfall within the country ranges from 500 mm to 2,000 mm per year, with the highest levels of
rainfall in the southern part of the country. Much of north central and northeastern South Sudan is located
in flood plains along the Nile River (the Sudd) that are flooded during the rainy season but receive little
rainfall otherwise (600 to 800 mm per year). The highest potential areas for agricultural production are
Western Equatoria and the southern half of Central Equatoria, or the so-called Green Belt, where annual
rainfall ranges from 900 to 2,000 mm per year (Table 2.6). Rainfall in the Hills and Mountains region of
the northern half of Central Equatoria and the western half of Eastern Equatoria (500 to 800 mm per year)
is also sufficient to support substantial crop agriculture (WFP 2011).
In most areas of South Sudan, soils are low in phosphorous as well as in organic matter. Despite
this, most soils are moderately fertile. But soils could quickly become nutrient deficient due to leaching
related to heavy rainfall, low levels of fertilizer use (on average only 4 kg per ha of fertilizers are used in
South Sudan), and over-farming. Nutrient mining from maize production ranges between 30 and 60 kg
per ha per year. Smallholders have limited knowledge and capacity, lack an understanding of the role of

6

fertilizer in improved crop production, and do not have access to extension or transfer services—all
factors that could lead to further soil nutrient depletion (Kowr 2013).
Institutional weakness has further hindered development of the agriculture sector. Disagreements
over land rights for crop cultivation and livestock grazing continue to be a major source of conflict. This
insecurity discourages farmers from expanding production, and traders and retailers from building
marketing infrastructure. The extremely low level of public investment in recent decades has meant that
essentially no irrigation infrastructure exists and only 2 percent of South Sudan’s limited road network is
paved. Roads are poorly maintained, not repaired, and completely washed out during the rainy season
(World Bank 2012; USAID and Fintrac 2012). Because of this inadequate transportation infrastructure, it
is difficult and expensive for subsistence farmers to transport surpluses to markets.
Further, poor business practices and a lack of information about market prices make it difficult
for businesses to develop along the agriculture value chain. South Sudan receives a ranking of 186 out of
189 on ease of doing business in the World Bank 2015 Doing Business report (World Bank 2014).
Furthermore, South Sudan receives a percentile rank of 5.7 in government effectiveness and of 3.0 in
control of corruption in the World Bank’s governance indicators (World Bank 2015).

3. CEREAL PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION, AND IMPORTS
Data on crop area and production for South Sudan are limited. The government of South Sudan, and FAO
and WFP (various years) both provide estimates of crop production, but neither estimate is based on
nationally representative farm surveys. The 2009 National Baseline Household Survey (NBHS) (Republic
of South Sudan, NBS 2009) can also be used to construct indirect estimates of production, but as
discussed below, these estimates are both somewhat dated and subject to considerable uncertainty.
According to estimates from the annual joint FAO and WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment
Mission (CFSAM) reports (FAO and WFP, various years), net cereal production (gross cereal production
less 20 percent for seed, feed, and wastage) has increased from 660 thousand tons in 2009/2010 to 892
thousand tons in 2014/2015, an average growth rate of 9.6 percent per year (Table 3.1, Table 3.2, and
Figure 3.1). 4 Over the same period, cereal area harvested rose from 852 thousand ha to 1.014 million ha,
an average growth rate of 5.5 percent, though there were substantial fluctuations. Yields also increased,
but by an average of only 3.8 percent per year, from 0.78 tons per ha to 1.00 tons per ha.

Alternative estimates of production can be derived from the consumption module of the 2009
NBHS. Using a food balance sheet approach, Diao et al (2011) estimated net food availability from
consumption data (quantity consumed in the previous week) along with assumptions regarding seed, feed,
and wastage. They then derived production and net imports from estimates of consumption out of own
production and the percentage of market purchases supplied by domestic production. This NBHS
household consumption–derived estimate of cereal production (995 thousand tons) is 21 percent above
the 2008/2009 CFSAM figure of 825 thousand tons (Table 3.3). As shown in Table 3.3, crop production
estimates for 2009 based on the estimates that Diao and colleagues (2011) derived from the NBHS put
total cereal production in South Sudan at 995 thousand tons, with sorghum (770 thousand tons) and maize
(175 thousand tons) accounting for 77 and 18 percent of the total, respectively. Combined production of
millet, rice, and wheat (37, 8, and 5 thousand tons, respectively) was only 5 percent of national cereal
production. The import estimates for 2009 are the residuals of estimated consumption less net production,
and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Using this method, it was estimated that 378
thousand tons of cereals were imported by South Sudan in 2009: 215 thousand tons of sorghum; 122
thousand tons of maize; and 18, 14, and 9 thousand tons of rice, wheat, and millet, respectively. 5

5 Estimates of production and consumption by crop can be derived from FAO/WFP CFSAM estimates of total cereal
production and shares of production by crop from NBHS / Diao and colleagues (2011); the end results are similar (Table 3.3).

Notes: Production 2009 Estimate I (Diao et al. 2011) is based on crop consumption, assuming that 55 percent of purchased
grain and flour from the market derives from domestically produced grain. Urban production estimates assume that all
urban purchases derive from grain produced in rural areas or imports. Production 2009 Estimate II uses FAO total cereal
production estimate and the estimated shares of each crop in total cereal production from Diao and colleagues (2011),
based on NBHS data. Imports are calculated as the difference between estimated consumption and net production. FAO
= Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; NBHS = 2009 National Baseline Household Survey. Tons
refers to metric tons.

However, there have been significant changes in population, agricultural production, and trade
flows in South Sudan since the 2009 NBHS. An estimated 1.962 million refugees from the Sudan–South
Sudan civil war returned to South Sudan between 2009 and 2013. 6 Returnees thus represented 17 percent
of the population in 2013 (Table 3.4). An estimated 263 thousand refugees settled in Central Equatoria,
the state where Juba is located, though data for the population of Juba show relatively little increase (from
398 thousand to 413 thousand). Subsequently, due to the internal conflict that began in December 2013,
there has been an exodus of 872 thousand people from South Sudan. Moreover, an estimated 1.54 million
people have become internally displaced since December 2013 (UNHCR 2015).

6 This

estimate does not include refugees who returned in 2011 because estimates do not exist for that year.

Production data for 2013 suggest a shift in crop production, with the share of maize in total
production of cereals rising from 18 percent in 2009 (NBHS) to 30 percent (CFSAM) in 2013. This
represents an increase of 142 percentage points in net cereal production. At the same time, the share of
sorghum in net cereal production fell from 77 percent in 2009 to 64 percent in 2013 (Figures 3.2 and 3.3
and Table 3.5). Moreover, this shift in crop production from maize to sorghum has been accompanied by
the continued production of other cereals, such as wheat, millet, and rice. While net sorghum production
increased by only 15 percentage points from 2009 to 2013, net production of millet, rice, and wheat
increased by 69, 40, and 40 percentage points, respectively.

Independence and the nearly complete disruption of trade with northern Sudan resulted in a major
shift in the composition of cereal imports between 2009 and 2013. Over this period, imports of sorghum
(mostly from northern Sudan) declined from an estimated 453 thousand tons to 317 thousand tons; at the
same time, imports of maize, wheat, and rice increased dramatically. Imports of maize increased from an
estimated 176 thousand tons in 2009 to 583 thousand tons in 2013. Imports of rice and wheat grew even
more dramatically, increasing from 21 and 15 thousand tons, respectively, in 2009 to 238 and 189
thousand tons, respectively, in 2013 (Table 3.5). 7
The cereal production and trade data for 2013 also imply a major shift in the role of maize, wheat
(including wheat products), and rice in the South Sudanese diet, perhaps due in part to the influx of
returnees and their consumption preferences as well as reduced availability of sorghum from Sudan.
Consumption levels of maize are now nearly equal to those of sorghum (75.1 and 78.7 kg per capita per
year, respectively), per capita maize consumption having risen by 113 percent while per capita sorghum
consumption fell by 33 percent. Rice and wheat consumption also increased sharply, from 3.2 and 2.3 kg
per capita per year, respectively, in 2009 to 21.4 and 16.8 kg per capita per year in 2013—a 574 percent
increase in per capita rice consumption and a 647 percent increase in per capita wheat consumption
(Table 3.5).
Household Cereal Consumption Patterns
Detailed information on current consumption patterns in South Sudan is unavailable, but the 2009 NBHS
data show significant variation in consumption patterns across households, much of which is not
explained by differences in levels of income (as proxied by total expenditures).
Throughout South Sudan, sorghum and maize are generally the major cereals consumed, though
there are regional differences. The NBHS data indicate that in 2009 sorghum consumption was 3.6 times
greater than maize consumption (the second most widely consumed cereal in South Sudan). At that time,
the average South Sudanese citizen consumed 10.3 kg of sorghum per month. Consumption per capita of
sorghum in rural areas was nearly double that in urban areas, at 11.07 and 6.87 kg per month, respectively
(Table 3.6). Per capita consumption of sorghum was particularly low in Juba (only about 3.4 kg per capita
per month), less than half the per capita consumption in other urban areas of South Sudan (Table 3.7).
There were marked regional differences in rural areas as well, with per capita consumption of sorghum in
rural areas of the north about 30 percent higher than in rural areas in the south. Finally, while there is a
noteworthy difference between urban and rural sorghum consumption, there is less variation between the
per capita sorghum consumption of nonpoor and poor individuals (Table 3.8).
Maize was the second leading cereal in terms of quantity consumed in 2009. Unlike with
sorghum, however, per capita consumption of maize in urban areas was higher than in rural areas. Urban
residents consumed 3.70 kg per capita per month, whereas rural residents consumed 2.63 kg per capita
per month. This gap, however, reflects the extremely high consumption of maize in Juba. People in the
city consumed on average 5.75 kg of maize a month, and it was the only region in 2009 where per capita
consumption of maize was higher than per capita consumption of sorghum. Further, as with sorghum,
there are significant regional differences in consumption patterns, with per capita consumption of maize
greater in the south than in the north (the reverse of the pattern for sorghum). Nationally, the top 40
percent of households in per capita expenditures consumed 1.5 times more maize than the bottom 60
percent. This gap was wider in urban areas than in rural areas (Table 3.7).

7 FEWS NET reported “anecdotal evidence of increased substitution of relatively cheaper local and imported red sorghum,
maize and maize flour for white sorghum from Sudan” (2014, 3), a finding consistent with the overall trade data.

Source: Calculated from 2009 National Baseline Household Survey (Republic of South Sudan, NBS 2009).
Notes: Figures shown are for the bottom 60 percent and top 40 percent of the national distribution of the total (food and
nonfood) per capita expenditure distributions.

Per capita consumption of wheat (including bread, pasta, and other wheat products), at 0.95 kg
per month, was only about one-third that of maize and one-tenth that of sorghum. Like that of maize, per
capita monthly wheat consumption was greater in urban areas (2.92 kg) than in rural areas (0.48 kg).
Across rural areas, wheat consumption was lower in the south than in the north. In fact, the bottom 40
percent of the rural south reported consuming only 0.09 kg of wheat per month. Wheat consumption in
Juba mirrors wheat consumption in other urban areas, though there is a sharp variation by income (per
capita expenditure) groups. Individuals in relatively rich households (the top 60 percent of the per capita
expenditure distribution) consume almost five times as much wheat as those in relatively poor households
(1.92 kg per month, as compared with only 0.40 kg per capita per month) (Table 3.7).
The 2009 NBHS data also indicate relatively small amounts of millet, rice, and other cereal
consumption. Average per capita monthly consumption of rice and wheat were only 0.38 and 0.34 kg,
respectively. The NBHS data also show 0.69 kg per month of consumption of other cereals (teff and local
cereals). Millet and other cereals are more widely consumed in rural areas than in urban areas, while rice
is consumed more in urban than in rural areas.
The above figures describe average household consumption, but many households do not
consume one or more of the main cereals. According to NBHS data on the number of people who
consumed each cereal in the week preceding the survey, sorghum was by far the most widely consumed
cereal in the country, with 85 percent of the national population reporting some sorghum consumption
(Tables 3.9 and 3.10). Sorghum consumption was even more prevalent in the north, with 92 percent of the
population reporting sorghum consumption in the week preceding the survey. In contrast, only 60 percent
of Juba’s population consumed sorghum. These figures mirror per capita consumption patterns for
sorghum. On the other hand, whereas maize was the second most important cereal in per capita
consumption, wheat was actually more widely consumed, with 33 percent of the population reporting
consumption of wheat (and wheat products) and only 30 percent reporting they had consumed maize.
Differences in prevalence of consumption are even more pronounced in urban areas. In 2009, 77 percent
of Juba’s residents and 74 percent of residents in other urban areas consumed wheat, while only 68
percent of Juba’s residents and 30 percent of residents in other urban areas consumed maize. At the same
time, however, many more people reported consuming only maize than reported consuming only wheat
(Figures 3.4 and 3.5). Further, approximately 37 percent of the population consumed sorghum and no
other staple (Figure 3.6). Other cereals, such as rice, millet, and other grains, were more widely consumed
in urban areas, though only 23 percent of people consumed these other cereals in all of South Sudan.

16

Nationally, 42 percent of households consume only one cereal (Tables 3.9 and 3.10). The
percentage of sorghum consumers that consume only sorghum ranges from about 4 percent in urban areas
other than Juba to 48 percent in southern rural areas, and from 49 percent in northern rural areas to 51
percent in Juba (Table 3.10). Households that consume only maize or wheat are even rarer. Only 14
percent of maize-consuming households and 3 percent of wheat-consuming households consume only that
cereal. More typical are combinations of sorghum with maize (37 percent of maize consumers,
nationally), and sorghum with wheat (41 percent of wheat consumers, nationally) (Figures 3.4, 3.5, and
3.6).

Spatial Cereal Price Variation
Although sorghum is the most widely consumed cereal in South Sudan, on average, it is not the cheapest
cereal. The reported national median price for sorghum in March and April 2009, when the household
survey was carried out, was 2.00 Sudanese pounds (SDG) per kilogram, whereas the median national
price for maize was only SDG 1.44 per kilogram (Table 3.11). In general, sorghum prices were higher in
urban areas than in rural areas. However, the range in sorghum prices across regions was greater than the
gap between rural and urban prices. In Juba and in the southern rural areas, the price of sorghum was 1.70
and 1.50 SDG per kilogram, respectively. In the rural north, the price of sorghum was SDG 2.19, and in
the other urban areas it was SDG 2.60.
Maize prices follow a different pattern. Maize was cheaper in the rural areas and more expensive
in urban areas. The price of maize in urban areas was SDG 1.88, while the price in rural areas was SDG
1.46. In Juba, unlike in all other areas, sorghum was on average cheaper than maize (Table 3.11). Wheat
and rice were far more expensive cereals than sorghum, maize, and millet. The median national price for
wheat as reported in 2009 was SDG 4.73 per kilogram and the median price for rice was SDG 4.00 per
kilogram. Wheat prices were higher in rural areas than in urban areas, likely reflecting the lack of
domestic wheat production and high transport costs incurred for imported wheat to reach rural markets.
The price of wheat in Juba was higher and closer to the rural prices than wheat prices in other urban areas,
perhaps reflecting quality differences in wheat and wheat products. The median price for rice was SDG
4.00 per kilogram in all areas but the rural south, where it was SDG 2.55 per kilogram (Table 3.11).

Household Budget Shares
On average, household spending on sorghum was twice as great as spending on all other cereals
combined. Further, spending on sorghum was almost as much as spending on nonfood items. The
dominance of sorghum in household budgets was especially pronounced for rural households, whose
average budget share for sorghum was 24.0 percent, as compared with only 9.9 percent for urban
households. Moreover, the poorest 60 percent of the population devoted a much higher budget share (25.9
percent) to sorghum than did the richest 40 percent of households (13.3 percent). These differences were
observed across all regions but were greater in rural areas than in urban areas (Table 3.12 and Figure 3.7).

Budget shares for sorghum were highest in the rural north, with poor households spending almost
as much on sorghum as they did on all other foods (and more than they spent on all nonfood items
together). The poor in the rural south also relied on sorghum as a major staple but spent a significant
amount on maize as well. Budget shares for sorghum were lowest in Juba, where average spending on
sorghum was only 5.2 percent of total expenditures for the poorest 60 percent, and only 2.6 percent for
the richest 40 percent.
20

The average budget share of maize in South Sudan was only 4.1 percent of household
expenditures: 4.3 percent in rural areas and 3.6 percent in urban areas. The maize budget share in Juba,
however, was considerably higher (5.5 percent) than that of other urban areas (only 2.7 percent). Overall,
the bottom 60 percent of the South Sudanese population spent more of its total expenditures on maize (4.8
percent) than the top 40 percent (3.0 percent).
The budget share for wheat was the third largest of the cereal budget shares, averaging 2.7
percent across South Sudan. Unlike maize and sorghum, however, the wheat budget shares were much
higher in urban areas, 4.9 percent, than in rural areas, 1.5 percent. Further, unlike sorghum and maize, the
expenditure share of wheat actually was greater for those in the top 40 percent compared with those in the
bottom 60 percent. At the same time, however, the increase in the budget share for the wealthy was
smaller than their increase in kilogram consumption. Rice spending, like wheat spending, was greater in
urban areas than in rural areas. Further, as with wheat, the budget share for rice increased with income,
but by less than the increase in kilogram consumption.
Livestock are also a major source of income and food consumption in South Sudan, as well as a
store of wealth. Nationally, there were an estimated 11.74 million cattle in 2009, an average of 1.34
animals per person. Ownership is higher in the northern regions than in Equatoria in the south (1.58 and
0.88 animals per person, respectively). According to the 2009 NBHS, 45 percent of the population lived
in households that consumed dairy products (50 percent in northern regions and 34 percent in Equatoria),
with consumption per capita in the northern regions double that of the south (2.10 versus 1.06 kg per
capita per month) (Figure 3.7).
Demand Elasticities
Econometric estimates of own-price and total expenditure (income) elasticities of demand for sorghum
and maize utilizing various functional forms suggest that, in general, consumers prefer maize to sorghum.
For sorghum, using the simplest equation (without inclusion of a squared term of the logarithm of
expenditures per person) and the national sample, the estimated coefficients imply expenditure and ownprice elasticities of 0.28 and -0.22, respectively. For maize, using the equation without a squared term and
the national-level sample, the estimated expenditure (income) elasticity is 0.61, about twice as large as the
estimates for sorghum (0.33). The estimate of the own-price elasticity of demand for maize (-0.15) is
slightly less than that of sorghum (-0.22), however.
Regressions using subsamples of the data produce broadly similar results for the price elasticities
but widely varying expenditure elasticities, almost all of which are statistically insignificant. Including the
logarithm of expenditures squared results in similar values for price elasticities across almost all regions
but widely varying expenditure elasticities at the regional level, with most coefficients not statistically
different from zero.
Elasticities of demand for maize in Uganda, estimated on a national sample of households, are
broadly similar to the above estimates for South Sudan (Boysen 2012). The estimated mean income
elasticities were 0.68 in rural areas and 0.37 in urban areas. Own-price elasticities of maize demand were
-0.93 and -0.71 in rural and urban areas, respectively. It should be noted, however, that national average
consumption patterns in Uganda differ from those in South Sudan, especially with regard to the far
greater consumption of roots and bananas in Uganda. 8

8 These elasticities were estimated using data from the 2005/2006 Ugandan National Household Survey, Boysen (2012), and
a quadratic almost-ideal demand system (QUAIDS) two-stage econometric model of household food demand with 12 food item
groups. (Maize was specified as one of the food items; sorghum was included in “other foods.”) Average food budget shares for
maize were 0.11 in rural areas and 0.08 in urban areas. Matooke (made from cooking bananas), sweet potatoes, and cassava have
a total food budget share of 0.33 in rural areas and 0.20 in urban areas.

4. CEREAL MARKETS AND PRICES
The 2009 NBHS data show that most households in South Sudan rely heavily on markets for their cereal
consumption. Urban households rely almost entirely on markets because urban production and in-kind
public transfers are very small. Rural households rely much more on their own harvests, yet in 2009 only
25 percent of the rural households who consumed sorghum got it from their own production. (The NBHS
question on source of supply refers to food consumption in the week prior to the survey, which was
conducted in April and May 2009.) Furthermore, only 26 percent of households consumed maize from
their own production. Consumption of wheat, the second most popular cereal in terms of number of
consumers, was almost entirely (95 percent at the national level) sourced from purchases.
Subsequent surveys carried out by the WFP in 2014 found that household production is the
largest source of sorghum only around harvest time (October). At all other times, the market is the main
supplier. By June, most households have exhausted their stocks, and markets supply between 60 and 70
percent of sorghum to sorghum-consuming households (FAO and WFP 2015).
In spite of the importance of markets to supply cereals for most households, markets in South
Sudan are still underdeveloped. Low levels of marketed surplus by farmers and meager market demand
due to widespread poverty result in thin markets in many areas, with relatively small volumes of trade and
few traders.
Structure of Cereal Markets
Market Actors
Grain traders from South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea operate in South
Sudan. Overall, there are more foreign traders than South Sudanese (WFP 2015). Most traders involved in
international trade operate in the informal rather than the formal sector because of high regulatory
compliance costs and numerous time-consuming administrative steps in the formal sector (AfDB 2013).
Traders from neighboring countries generally prefer to cross into South Sudan and sell their goods at local
markets rather than sell their goods at the border to their South Sudanese counterparts. Likewise, South
Sudanese traders prefer to travel to neighboring countries to search for, assemble, and purchase their
goods. As a result, for both South Sudanese traders and their foreign counterparts, commodity purchasing
and transporting can be expensive and take a long time (Ngigi 2008).
The Marketing Chain
For the most part, farmer sales in South Sudan take place at farmgate and involve relatively small
quantities. 9 Since there are few functioning rural roads, assembly is often done using bicycles over narrow
paths. The goods are then transferred to shared trucks (Ngigi 2008).
There are three principal types of truck transport: individually hired trucks, collectively hired trucks, and
transporter-trader trucks (WFP 2015). Individually hired trucks are rented by large-scale wholesalers who
procure large volumes of commodities to minimize costs. Collectively hired trucks are rented by a group
of traders who individually procure small volumes of commodities. Owners of transporter-trader trucks
are directly involved in trade as well as transport, buying perishable bulky commodities and reselling
them off their trucks in South Sudanese markets (Ngigi 2008).
Retailers operate at three different scales. Very small retailers operate at a designated place within each
market. Medium-sized retailers sell from fixed stores but typically lack the capacity to consistently supply
the market with goods. Wholesalers participate in large-scale retail trade or sell goods off their trucks
(Wambua 2009).
9 A major exception is sales from Sudan’s mechanized farms in the Greater Upper Nile region that produce large volumes of
sorghum.

22

Transport
Poor road and river infrastructure continue to hinder market development in South Sudan. South Sudan
ranks far below all other African countries in terms of its road network and the condition of its roads. In
2011, the country had only 15 km of road per 1,000 km2 of arable land (World Bank 2012a). Further, less
than 5 percent of the existing 7,171 km of primary roads were in good condition, and only 2 percent of the
primary road network was paved (World Bank 2012a). In 2012, the road from Nimule, on the border with
Uganda, to Juba was one of the few paved roads in South Sudan. Other important border roads, such as
the road from Yei to Kaya, remained unpaved and washed out in many areas (USAID 2012).
As a result of the low density and poor condition of the roads, as well as the low volume of trade,
transport costs are extremely high. Since many markets across the country are fed Uganda’s goods via the
route from Nimule (a major land port) to Juba, transporters are forced to haul goods sometimes across the
entire country on poor-quality interstates and back roads. Deterioration of roads in the rainy season also
adds to costs, with trucks often forced to carry only small loads (Wambua 2009). Further, uncertain fuel
supply networks (frequent disruption or delays in fuel deliveries) often lead to fuel shortages and high
price disparities. For example, at the end of 2014 the average price for 1 liter of diesel fuel was SSP 6 in
Juba; between SSP 10 and SSP 15 in Bor, Wau Aweil, Renk, Kuajok, and Rumbek; SSP 20 in Malakal;
and SSP 25 in Maban (FAO and WFP 2015). Finally, because South Sudan exports far less to its
neighbors than it imports from them, trucks enter South Sudan with goods but often return empty to
Uganda, Kenya, or Sudan, essentially doubling transport costs faced by trucking companies (WFP 2015).
Physical Market Infrastructure
There are four types of food markets in Sudan: rural primary markets located in villages and small towns,
rural assembly markets located in agricultural surplus areas, urban retail markets, and markets in
Protection of Civilians site camps of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (Table 4.1).
Retailers and traders operate with very low storage capacities. Storage capacities are lowest in the
Greater Upper Nile region because conflict makes investment very risky. In its 2008 and 2009 studies, the
Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) found that storage facilities were typically small
rooms measuring between 10 by 10 feet and 30 by 30 feet that also serve as sales areas (Ngigi 2008;
Wambua 2009). The majority (64 percent) of the retailers held commodities for only up to 2 weeks, while
the majority (69 percent) of wholesalers held their commodities for up to 3 months.
Other Market Institutions and Constraints
Banking Services
Inadequate banking services, for both foreign exchange transactions and credit, also inhibit trade in South
Sudan. Foreign currency is not easily accessible through banks. Traders typically change their South
Sudanese pounds to US dollars in Torit or Juba and then exchange the dollars for Ugandan shillings to
pay for goods and transport in Kampala. Additionally, traders are faced with double risks associated with
potential foreign exchange losses due to fluctuations in Sudanese pound–US dollar exchange rate and the
US dollar–Uganda shilling exchange rate. Traders also lack access to banks to hold deposits (Wambua
2009). Therefore, retailers, traders, and transporters have to rely on risky modes of handling and storing
cash for their businesses. Further, because of the lack of banks, traders have to use nonbanking systems
for money transfers to pay for imports and thus do not have access to essential trade instruments, such as
letters of credit, to enhance their business efficiency.

The market in Akobo is constrained by limited demand
and contracted supply. Households have little
purchasing power.
During the rainy season, road connections are cut off
and river transport is the only viable alternative.
The market was completely destroyed when the violence
broke out, with almost no trading activities in the
subsequent few months.
There is very limited storage capacity due to conflict.
With most of South Sudan’s mechanized farms located
nearby, the market used to be one of the region’s
foremost trading hubs.
Insecurity has affected the agricultural season, reducing
the overall area cultivated, the output, and thereby, the
crops sold in the market.
One-fourth of the population in Malakal has been
displaced into PoCs or other IDP sites.
The remainder has moved elsewhere in the countryside
or left the Upper Nile for destinations such as Khartoum
and Juba.
Poor purchasing power and few customers are major
issues with the markets.
The area remains one of the most disputed in South
Sudan.
Market functionality is severely limited by the appalling
road conditions and widespread insecurity, which
effectively make Bentiu an economy under siege, with
hardly any fuel available.
Almost half of the traders left after the violence; the
remaining traders run small-scale businesses.

Konyo traders reported a sharp decline in customers
coming from conflict-affected areas such as Malakal
and Bentiu, while in the past large volumes used to be
purchased from the Greater Upper Nile.
Since the conflict started, local demand has fallen
because IDPs receiving food assistance are less
dependent on markets.
Challenges include a lack of credit and foreign
exchange to import food commodities, and high
taxation at checkpoints, with traders paying up to SSP
7,000 between Kaya and Yambio.
Due to distance from Juba, the main trade access
routes are poor and often impassable during the rainy
season.
In 2015 one of the two entry routes from Sudan was
reported to be closed.
Trade routes to Wau, Rumbek, and Yambio are in a
poor state and impassable at several points.
The poor road conditions, together with several
roadblocks and high taxes, significantly increase the
cost of business, pushing up prices.
The conflict has had no direct impact on markets, but it
has created general insecurity and uncertainty, leading
to numerous roadblocks and extortion through official
and unofficial taxes.
Many of the roads toward Rumbek and Tambura—the
routes followed by supplies from East Africa (via
Uganda)—are inaccessible.

Taxation and Checkpoints
High taxation at customs and at checkpoints across South Sudan are barriers to both trade and market
development. Taxes paid include an import duty; a value-added tax (VAT); and state, commerce, and
county taxes, as well as a final business profit tax and other levies. Cereals are subject to a 10 percent
import duty, a VAT of 15 percent and a Standards Bureau charge of 3 percent (Ngigi 2008). In addition,
traders are subject to a mixture of local taxes, including a state tax of 10 percent, a Ministry of Commerce
tax of 3 percent, and a variable county tax (Wambua 2009).
Checkpoints are numerous and payments are widespread. According to a survey conducted by the
National Bureau of Statistics in November and December 2010, there are four checkpoints per 100 km
along the major South Sudanese trade routes, and drivers make payments at 97 percent or more of the
checkpoints. While the largest payments occur at the international borders, payments on internal routes
can be up to 8 percent of the value of goods transported. Although most payments are small (only 4
percent were more than 500 SDG), total payment is significant, with average payments per 100 km
exceeding 100 SDG on average. Around 47 percent of individual payments made during the survey were
not receipted (NBS 2011.
Wait times at checkpoints are very long. On the Kaya-Juba trade route the average payment was
4.9 percent of the value of goods transported, and the average wait time was 24 hours 32 minutes. On the
Nimule-Juba route the average payment is 15.4 percent of the value of goods transported, and the average
wait time was 5 hours 39 minutes (NBS 2011).
Security
Security has always been an issue for trading and market development in the region. Weak institutions,
combined with political uncertainty cause continued insecurity among traders. This situation worsened
with the beginning of the conflict in December 2013.
The conflict has created an environment of insecurity with the proliferation of banditry and
looting. The insecurity has permeated most of the trading routes, with many unofficial checkpoints and
roadblocks being set up to extort money (WFP 2015). Further, in addition to security threats in South
Sudan, there is weak security across border countries. Traders have not been able to put in place any
measures to mitigate any of these risks and are therefore bearing all the costs.
Market Prices and Cross-border Trade of Sorghum and Maize
Market prices of sorghum and maize in South Sudan have risen substantially over time, along with overall
macroeconomic inflation, and have also been highly variable (Figure 4.1). The price of sorghum in the
Konyo Konyo market (the main grain wholesale market in Juba) rose by 81 percent in nominal terms
between 2009 and 2014. In the same period, the price of maize rose even more, by 92 percent (Table 4.2).
In real terms (adjusted for 111 percent overall inflation in the South Sudanese economy), however,
sorghum and maize prices fell by 14 and 12 percent, respectively (Figure 4.2).

Notes: Import parity Juba retail is estimated as wholesale Kampala (US$/ton) times the parallel exchange rate (SDG/US$) plus
marketing costs from Kampala (or Gulu) to Juba, multiplied by 1.2 to account for the retail marketing margin. Marketing
costs from Kampala (or Gulu) to Juba are based on an estimate of 0.15 SSP/kg in December 2010 adjusted for changes
in marketing costs over time using percentage changes in the parallel exchange rate (SDG / Uganda shilling). MT =
metric tons; SDG = Sudanese pounds; SSP = South Sudanese pounds.

Despite substantial cross-border trade in sorghum with Uganda, prices in Juba have diverged
from import parity prices (Figure 4.3). The sorghum retail price in Juba (at the Konyo Konyo market) was
on average 2.8 times the average of the retail prices in both Kampala and Gulu (a major district market in
northern Uganda). Sorghum retail prices in Juba were also 48 percent higher than the calculated import
parity sorghum price (from Gulu) from January 2007 through December 2014.
The Juba sorghum price was also higher than the Juba white maize price over this period (the
retail maize price was on average 20 percent below the retail sorghum price in Juba). In contrast, the
import parity price of maize sourced from Uganda was on average 27 percent higher than the import
parity price of sorghum sourced from Uganda. In comparison with Uganda prices, the relatively high
sorghum prices in Juba likely reflect a difference in the quality of sorghum, with locally produced white
sorghum getting a price premium relative to imported mixed (red) sorghum in the Juba retail market.
Nonetheless, the price data present a puzzle because, apart from quality differences, there would appear to
be a strong price incentive for more imports of sorghum from Uganda. To the extent that this large margin
is due to the riskiness of the trade, numerous unofficial tolls, and lack of competition, the margin between
import parity prices and domestic prices would diminish if the security situation and the efficiency of
trade were to improve. 10

10 Note, however, that the average retail price of sorghum in the Konyo Konyo market in 2014 essentially matched the
average import parity price, though the domestic price was 19 percent above import parity in the first half of the year and 24
percent below import parity in the second half of the year.

In contrast to sorghum prices, prices of white maize in Juba have been generally much closer to
import parity prices of white maize sourced from Uganda (Figure 4.4). From January 2008 through
December 2014 (no data are available for white maize prices in 2007), domestic prices of white maize
were on average only 6 percent below import parity prices (Table 4.2). Moreover, the correlation
coefficient between white maize retail and import parity prices in the Juba market was 0.844. (By way of
comparison, the correlation coefficient between retail and import parity prices for sorghum was only
0.720). 11 In fact, retail market white maize prices closely matched import parity prices in all but two
periods. In the first period, January 2010–February 2011, domestic prices exceeded import parity prices
by an average of 38 percent (suggesting perhaps that maize import flows were in some way restricted in
this period). In the second period, October 2013–July 2014, reliable data are not available, perhaps
reflecting problems in data collection during the outbreak of civil conflict. 12
Domestic prices of both maize and sorghum exhibit substantial seasonal movements, as shown by
a seasonal index of monthly retail prices relative to a 12-month centered moving average of prices (Figure
4.5). Sorghum prices tend to peak in January and fall steeply by May, most likely due to the first-season
harvests in southern South Sudan and in Uganda. Sorghum prices then rise until August before falling
again in September with the onset of the second-season harvest in the South and the single harvest in
northern areas with unimodal rainfall. Maize prices follow similar seasonal patterns, with peaks in
January and July, and troughs in April and November.

11

Note also that the correlation coefficient of the prices of maize and sorghum in the Juba retail market (0.885) and the
correlation coefficient of the import parity prices of maize and sorghum (0.889) are both higher than correlation coefficients of
either commodity with import parity prices, in part because of domestic inflation that affects domestic retail prices.
12 In this period, the data show nearly constant retail maize prices.

29

Rainfall patterns contribute to cause seasonality of prices and trade. FEWS NET reported that
“sorghum exports from Uganda flowed to South Sudan’s markets of Juba, Wau and Aweil between
January and May when prices are rising and roads are passable” (2014, 3). After May, imports of
sorghum from Uganda decline due to consumption of fresh (green) maize, a decline in market prices in
areas that grow short-maturing crops, and a worsening road conditions in areas where the rainy season has
begun. Similarly, most of South Sudan’s maize imports from Uganda occur between January and May,
when prices are high and roads passable. Nonetheless, in 2014, this trade was “erratic due to conflictrelated trade disruptions” (FEWS NET 2014, 2).

5. OPTIONS FOR A NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY RESERVE SYSTEM
This chapter outlines a national food security reserve (NFSR) system that could enhance food security in
South Sudan through public stocks, domestic and international procurement, carefully managed
distribution, market monitoring, and policy analysis. As discussed below, however, such a system need
not involve all aspects of food security interventions, especially in its initial phases.
One major factor contributing to food insecurity in South Sudan is the absence of wellfunctioning markets in the country due to inadequate infrastructure, warehousing, price information, and
other market institutions. Feeder or rural roads are nonexistent in many rural areas, and even when they
exist, they require frequent maintenance. Low levels of marketed surplus by farmers and meager market
demand by households due to widespread poverty result in thin markets with relatively small volumes of
trade and few traders. Moreover, market functioning is limited due to information asymmetry (not all
buyers and sellers have the same information), unequal market power (large farmers and traders may have
more access to credit, transport, and storage), and high search costs (in linking buyers and sellers).
Further, there are major institutional weaknesses, such as the lack of risk-management institutions and
imperfect credit and insurance markets that also hinder the efficient functioning of cereal markets. All
these factors combined tend to increase price volatility and make agriculture a risky business.
Given these market imperfections, along with recurring weather-related and conflict-induced
shocks, and widespread poverty and vulnerability, a well-designed NFSR system could provide
substantial benefits to South Sudan. The goal of the system would be to protect the poor without
distorting markets and, in the medium term, to contribute toward long-run market development.
Price stabilization would not necessarily be a major objective of the NFSR system, however.
Broad price stability is important for South Sudan because large negative shocks seriously affect the wellbeing of both producers and consumers. Stable and broadly predictable prices benefit producers by
enabling them to make more accurate calculations of their potential net incomes; this promotes
investments needed for agricultural growth. Likewise, price stability aids consumers by enabling them to
better plan consumption and saving decisions and to avoid sharp losses in purchasing power and
consumption that could result from large price spikes (Timmer 1997).
Yet market interventions have proven to be not only ineffective in many countries but extremely
costly as well. Food reserves involve both direct and indirect costs. The direct costs include costs of
holding stocks, such as the cost of the agencies responsible for managing stocks, the opportunity costs of
capital engaged in food stocks, and allowable storage losses. On the other hand, there are often indirect
costs due to very high storage losses, high overhead costs, mismanagement, and theft. These problems
threaten the success of market operations in many countries and could happen to the NFSR system in
South Sudan as well.
International Experience
The notion of a food security stock often elicits deep skepticism because in many countries such stocks
have been central to relatively complex systems aimed at price stabilization involving domestic purchases
and sales of grain, usually at fixed prices. These systems typically have too many objectives, too many
stakeholders, and too many institutions involved. They can also be very expensive and involve large
subsidies.
In many cases, these food stock and distribution systems suffer from severe governance problems
and corruption that greatly inflate their costs and sharply reduce their benefits to the intended
beneficiaries—typically farmers and poor consumers. Moreover, once these systems are put in place,
political lobbies may push for large-scale domestic procurement, leading to massive producer subsidies
(as in Pakistan, India, the European Union, and the United States). Further, to the extent that a national
security stock system is involved in international trade, a lack of transparency by government agencies
and frequent changes in policy can discourage private-sector trade and investment. This is particularly
true for the countries that have integrated models in which government is involved in all aspects of food

31

grain marketing and distribution. Examples of such models include India, Indonesia, and Pakistan in Asia,
and Kenya, Zambia, and Malawi in Africa. Asian experiences suggest that while the food reserve
systems, and the policies around them, played important roles in the early years of the Green Revolution,
maintaining the systems became expensive and counterproductive over time (Rashid, Gulati, and
Cummings 2008). Experiences have been similar in Africa. According to one study, the cost of
stockholding in Kenya was US$11 million in 2009, compared with only about US$2 million in Ethiopia
(Rashid, Lemma, and Thangata, 2010). This is mainly because Ethiopia, unlike Kenya, has substantially
withdrawn from the integrated model and moved toward a less complex system. Other countries, such as
Bangladesh, Mozambique, and Uganda, have also successfully moved toward less complex systems,
which resulted in improved efficiency and budgetary savings.
In spite of the negative experiences of many countries, it is nonetheless possible to have a system
of public stocks and food safety nets, and promote domestic agricultural production and market
development at the same time. A prime example is Bangladesh, where cereal import liberalization in the
late 1980s maintained incentives for private-sector imports alongside government commercial imports
and food aid. The country’s policy combined three key elements: public food distribution, public
investment, and price incentives. Bangladesh liberalized domestic grain markets in the late 1980s. During
that time, there was political will for long-term public investments in agricultural research, extension, and
market infrastructure (public goods elements). Bangladesh invested heavily in rural roads (through foodfor-work and other programs). Through the food security stock program, the country targeted distribution
through food-for-work, food-for-education, and other transfer programs (conditional transfers). Further, it
maintained price incentives for domestic production by avoiding large-scale subsidized imports, keeping
domestic producer prices at medium-term import parity price levels.
As a result, the public share of rice marketed fell from 30 percent in the 1960s to 11 percent in the
1980s to 5 percent in 2000. At the same time, long-term production increases led to a 30 percent decline
in the real price of rice from the early 1980s to the early 1990s. Further, despite large amounts of wheat
food aid flows, averaging 1.03 million tons per year, Bangladesh’s wheat production more than doubled,
from 829 thousand tons in 1979/1980 to 1.84 million tons in 1999/2000. For this to occur, food aid flows
were managed so as to maintain incentives for production and trade (domestic prices were generally at
import parity levels) (Ahmed, Haggblade, and Chowdhury 2000; del Ninno, Dorosh, and Subbarao 2007).
In years of large domestic production shortfalls, such as those following the massive 1998 floods
that at one point covered up to two-thirds of Bangladesh, private-sector rice imports added to domestic
supplies quickly and at no cost to the government, stabilizing prices and preventing what otherwise would
have been a serious drop in food consumption (Dorosh 2001; del Ninno et al. 2001). At the same time, the
country maintained public stocks of rice and wheat, as well as a public food grain distribution system
effectively targeted to the poor and supplied mainly from food aid inflows and public commercial food
imports. Ultimately, the gains from the price stabilizing effects of private rice imports outweighed the
massive 2 million tons of food aid inflows (del Ninno, Dorosh, and Smith 2003).
Thus, international experience suggests that, in general, the best approach to price stabilization
involves a combination of promoting domestic and international trade, with food security stocks and
public imports used on a more limited basis. Such a system could be designed to prevent large price
spikes in times of shortage (through sales of stocks or public imports at subsidized prices). Boosting
producer prices following bumper harvests, a more operationally difficult task requiring government
purchases, likely would be feasible in South Sudan only on a much more limited basis.
Operational Issues: Size of Stock, Stock Management, and Policy Analysis
For South Sudan, private-sector imports of maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice from Uganda are likely to be
crucial to maintaining national food supplies for at least several more years. Whatever measures are taken
involving procurement and distribution of grain, South Sudan’s NFSR system should be careful to
maintain incentives for this private trade and avoid destabilizing market supplies and domestic prices.

32

One way to avoid problems arising from complex systems of domestic procurement and sales,
such as in systems designed to protect floor prices for producers and ceiling prices for consumers, is to
begin with a modest system of relatively small cereal stocks with only limited goals. For example, an
initial food security stock could consist of a relatively small amount of cereals (on the order of 50 to 100
thousand tons) stored in a small number of warehouses in Juba and perhaps two to four other locations.
Grain for this stock could initially come largely from food aid or government commercial imports, with
distribution of the cereals through existing targeted safety net or relief programs. Later, as domestic
production increases and the national food security stock system matures, grain could increasingly be
procured from domestic sources.
The Productive Safety Net Project (PSNP) in Ethiopia, which involves cash and food distribution
to food-insecure households selected with community input at the local level, provides useful parameters
for a possible (smaller-scale) safety net in South Sudan. Ethiopia’s PSNP targets about 7.8 million
individuals a year, while recipients of food aid from WFP in South Sudan number 1.06 million a year.
Both programs cater to around 9 percent of the population. 13 The quantity of cereal distribution in WFP
programs in South Sudan in 2013 was 9.6 kg per person per month, while the average PSNP distribution
in Ethiopia is only 4.4 kg per person per month. Finally, while the PSNP program operates only during
the most food-scarce times of the year, the WFP distributes food aid throughout the year in South Sudan
(Table 5.1).

Figure 5.1 shows WFP monthly distribution of cereals in South Sudan from January 2012 through
April 2013. Distribution of emergency food aid is highest from April through September, a period of
relatively low supply and high prices, reflecting the seasonality of cereal production, given that a major
harvest in the bimodal rainfall area (primarily in the southern part of the country) occurs in August–
September and the major harvest in unimodal areas (generally further north) occurs in September–
October. During this time it is important that the NFSR have a large enough stock to satisfy increased
demand.

The simplest method of calculating a minimum stock level would be to use the average level of
distribution per month with an adjustment for transport and delivery lags. Assuming a two-month lead
time for procurement, transport, and delivery, and given average monthly distribution in the 2012/2013
period of about 10 thousand tons, the minimum stock level would be 30 thousand tons.
A more refined calculation could take into account the seasonality of distribution needs. For
example, the minimum stock requirement for each month could be calculated as the average distribution
of the subsequent three months (that is, a three-period leading moving average of stocks):
Min. Stock (t) = Ave. Distribution (t + 1) + Ave. Distribution (t + 2) + Ave. Distribution (t + 3)
For months for which the calculated minimum stock in the above formula falls below the 30
thousand ton threshold, the minimum stock could be set at 30 thousand tons. Under this approach, the
minimum stock would rise from 30.0 thousand tons at the end of January to 41.0 thousand tons at the end
of February, to 52.3 and 53.6 thousand tons at the end of March and end of April, respectively.
Thereafter, the minimum stock target would gradually decline to 32.5 thousand tons in July before again
reaching the annual monthly minimum of 30.0 thousand tons for August through December (Table 5.2
and Figure 5.1). Note that as distribution requirements increase, calculated minimum stock levels would
increase accordingly.
In the initial years of the reserve stock, grain would be supplied mostly through imports, which
can be timed to closely mirror the stock targets. Later, when domestic procurement is a major source of
supply, stock levels would be higher than the minimum target in the months immediately following the
harvest (October–November), when procurement takes place.
34

It is important to emphasize again, however, that relatively small stocks such as those described
above cannot be expected to effectively stabilize prices in the event of a major shock to domestic
production. Rather, a national food security stock could help ensure that enough grain would be available
for limited targeted distribution programs for the most food-insecure households and for emergency relief
operations.

Implementation of the NFSR System
The creation of a South Sudan NFSR involves more than the construction of warehouses and the
collection of grain that will make up physical stocks. It involves a system of institutions and procedures
for acquiring grain (including food aid, domestic procurement, and government commercial imports),
channels for distribution (open market sales, targeted distribution programs), and management decisions
with respect to quantity and timing of procurement and distribution.
First, a government proclamation formally creating the NFSR is needed. In this proclamation or
other subsequent documents, it would be necessary to create an implementing agency within government
and then provide this agency with a minimum core staff for initial operations. The agency would be
responsible for managing the food stock system as well as carrying out humanitarian operations in case of
emergencies and unforeseen events causing disruption in supply.
Second, the first-year procurement and distribution plan could be integrated closely with the WFP
food aid program, but over time the implementing agency within the government of South Sudan should
be expected to play the lead role in the planning, execution, and monitoring of operations. As the system
expands, additional warehouses may need to be constructed or rented. In particular, construction of larger
warehouses at a central facility (most likely near Juba) would likely be needed within a few years of
initiation of the food security stock.
Third, institutional support for the system should be built gradually over time. This includes
monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness of targeting (amount of various kinds of “leakages”), early
warning and crop forecasting (initially done with the support of international organizations such as FAO
and FEWS NET), analytical support for determining stock targets, analysis of market prices and
availability, and a clear transition or scaling-up strategy. Eventually, the food and agricultural policies
should be owned and run by the government.
35

The administrative structure of the PSNP and the National Strategic Food Reserve Agency
(NSFRA) in Ethiopia is one option for the NFSR in South Sudan. PSNP is administered by the Disaster
Risk Management and Food Security Service, part of the Ministry of Agriculture. The NSFRA, which
manages the actual food stocks, is governed by a board consisting of the ministers of finance, agriculture,
trade, and internal affairs. At a second level, there is a consultative, multistakeholder technical committee
composed of representatives from the government of Ethiopia, development partners, UN agencies, the
Ethiopian Grain Trade Enterprise, and a nongovernmental organization. The most appropriate form and
membership of similar committees in an NFSR for South Sudan would depend, however, on institutional
factors particular to the government of South Sudan.

36

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
South Sudan faces serious problems of food insecurity due to low per capita levels of domestic food
production, periodic droughts, widespread poverty, political unrest, and since late 2013, renewed armed
conflict. The country is currently highly dependent on private-sector imports of cereals (maize, sorghum,
wheat, and rice) from Uganda and, to a lesser extent, from other neighboring countries. Cereal imports
accounted for an estimated 39.6 percent of total net availability in 2009 and can be expected to account
for a similar percentage if the security problems are resolved in the next few years.
Emergency food aid has long been a major component of the food supply and a centerpiece of
national and donor strategy to address food insecurity in South Sudan. Prior to independence, food aid
stocks were held mainly in northern Sudan or outside the country (in the case of donor stocks). 14 Since
independence, however, the independent government of South Sudan has demonstrated renewed interest
in creating a national food stock as part of an NFSR system. Under such a system, a national stock,
supplied initially by food aid but ultimately by domestic procurement of cereals, would provision
emergency relief and targeted safety net operations.
Cereal Production, Consumption, and Trade
Production estimates remain highly uncertain, but according to annual crop assessments, net cereal
production increased from 688 thousand tons in 2009 to 964 thousand tons in 2013, a 40 percent increase
due almost entirely to increases in area cultivated. Given an estimated 32 percent increase in population
(8.7 million in 2009 to 11.5 million in 2013, including 2.0 million returnees), per capita cereal production
increased by 22 percent.
In the medium term, increasing domestic production of food is essential for food security, not
only to reduce dependence on imports but to raise rural incomes and thereby increase household access to
food. Overall, there is substantial suitable land available, but cultivated land remains only a small share
(about 4 percent) due to continuing insecurity, competition with livestock (open grazing), poor
infrastructure, and lack of markets (Diao et al. 2011). In the shorter term, however, availability of food is
threatened by drought and potential disruptions in imports.
The patterns of production and diversity of cereal consumption across households in South Sudan
(and the lack of recent reliable data) present special challenges to the design of an NFSR system.
Sorghum and maize account for most of the country’s domestically produced cereal, but there is little
marketable surplus due to small farm size, low productivity, and weak market incentives for sales. In the
medium term, though, there may be considerable scope for expansion of maize production. 15
Consumption of cereals is considerably more diverse, with wheat (including bread) and, in recent
years, rice accounting for an estimated 10.8 percent of cereal consumption in the country. FEWS NET
data on South Sudan’s cereal imports and FAO production data suggest that imports accounted for 49.9
percent of total cereal availability in 2013, including 46.0 percent of sorghum, 59.2 percent of maize, 81.7
percent of wheat, and 78.2 percent of rice (Table 3.3). Given the very small marketable surplus from
domestic production, the data suggest that Juba and other major cities are supplied almost exclusively by
imports for most of the year. Thus, promoting the private trade in cereal imports is crucial to maintaining
food security in South Sudan, especially for urban consumers, and will likely remain so until substantial
investments are made in domestic agriculture and infrastructure.

In 2008, the provincial government of South Sudan created a national food security stock of sorghum, but donor support
for this effort was canceled only one year later due to misuse of funds, resulting in a loss of more than US$4 billion.
15 Maize production increased by 133 percent per year between 2009 and 2013, while sorghum production stagnated (an
increase of only 11 percent).
14

37

Most of South Sudan’s population lacks sufficient access to food—an estimated 10 percent of the
population consumes less than 2,100 kilocalories per adult equivalent per day. The diversity of cereal
consumption enhances food security in South Sudan to some extent, however, since it may enable
households to adjust to adverse shocks to supply (production or trade) and prices of one or two
commodities more easily. Moreover, patterns of consumption vary substantially by location (the northern
provinces in comparison with the Equitorias to the south), by income group, and between rural and urban
areas.
Sorghum and maize are the most widely consumed cereals, particularly in rural areas, and
consumption patterns naturally follow patterns of production, with maize production concentrated in
southern provinces and sorghum (a more drought-tolerant crop) more equally distributed across South
Sudan. Overall, according to the 2009 NBHS data (Republic of South Sudan, NBS 2009), sorghum
accounted for 75 percent of cereal consumption in rural areas and 51 percent in urban areas. For urban
areas, the share for sorghum drops to 51 percent, the share of maize rises to 35 percent, and the shares of
rice and wheat reach 7 and 6 percent, respectively.
Analysis of the household consumption data suggests that wheat and rice are preferred foods in
urban areas, with cross-section data showing that their budget shares increase as total (food and nonfood)
per capita expenditures rise. For urban areas, there is relatively little difference in budget shares of
sorghum and maize as total per capita expenditure rises, though the share of sorghum does fall for the
higher per capita expenditure quintile (the 20 percent of households with the highest per capita
expenditures). Patterns are similar in rural areas, except that the share of sorghum consumption does not
decline as much, in part because sorghum production is a major source of income for most rural
households.
Econometric analysis suggests that, in general, the average South Sudan consumer prefers maize
to sorghum. The estimated expenditure (income) elasticity for maize is 0.61, about twice as large as the
estimates for sorghum (0.33); that is, the increase in consumption resulting from a 1 percent increase in
income is substantially larger for maize than for sorghum. Demand for both commodities is price
inelastic, with a small (less than 1 percent) decrease in quantity resulting from a 1 percent increase in
price. The estimate of the own-price elasticity of demand for maize (-0.15) is slightly less than that for
sorghum (-0.22), however.
The import and production data suggest that there have been dramatic changes in household
consumption patterns since 2008. Rice consumption (estimated as equal to net production plus imports)
increased by more than 800 percent between 2009 and 2013 (from 27 thousand tons to 246 thousand
tons). Wheat consumption increased by more than 900 percent, from 19 thousand tons to 194 thousand
tons. Wheat and rice consumption per capita are likely highest in urban areas, because South Sudan
produces very little wheat or rice. The lack of recent household survey data prohibits definitive
statements, however.
Markets and Market Prices
Several recent studies provide descriptions of the structure, conduct, and performance of markets in South
Sudan, including WFP (2015), World Bank (2012a), and earlier studies by Ngigi (2008) and Wambua
(2009). According to these studies, farmer sales of cereals generally take place at farmgate and involve
relatively small quantities. Except for those living along primary roads, few rural residents have reliable
access to markets. The majority of roads are impassible during the rainy season. As a result of the low
density and poor condition of the roads, transport costs are extremely high. Uncertain fuel supply, high
fuel costs, and the difficulty of transporting goods in the rainy season (when road conditions deteriorate,
making it impractical to use large trucks) also all add to costs and risks. For the import trade, because of
the small volume of exports from South Sudan, trucks often return to neighboring countries nearly empty,
essentially doubling the transport costs faced by trucking companies.

38

Retailers and traders operate with very low storage capacities. Inadequate banking services, both
for foreign exchange transactions and for credit, also inhibit trade in South Sudan. As a result, retailers,
traders, and transporters have to rely on risky modes of handling and storing cash for their businesses. In
addition, high taxation at customs and at checkpoints across South Sudan, and lack of access to current
information on market, road, and security conditions also add to trader costs and reduce market
efficiency. Moreover, the conflict since December 2013 has exacerbated the environment of insecurity
with the proliferation of banditry and looting.
Market Prices and Cross-border Trade of Sorghum and Maize
Market prices of sorghum and maize have risen substantially over time, along with overall
macroeconomic inflation, and have also been highly variable. Between 2009 and 2014, the price of
sorghum in the Konyo Konyo market (the main market in Juba) rose by 81 percent in nominal terms (but
dropped by 14 percent in real terms); the price of maize rose slightly more, by 92 percent in nominal
terms (and fell by 12 percent in real terms).
In spite of substantial cross-border trade in sorghum and maize with Uganda, however, prices in
Juba have not been closely correlated with prices in Uganda. The Juba retail sorghum price (Konyo
Konyo market) was on average 2.8 times the average of both the retail price in Kampala and the retail
price in Gulu (a major market in northern Uganda). Retail Juba prices for sorghum were also 48 percent
above the calculated import parity price (from Gulu) from January 2007 through December 2014.
The Juba sorghum price was also higher than the Juba white maize price over this period (the
retail maize price was on average 20 percent below the retail sorghum price in Juba). In contrast, the
import parity price of maize sourced from Uganda was on average 27 percent higher than the import
parity price of sorghum sourced from Uganda. Further work is needed, however, to better understand
variations in quality and price of sorghum across markets.
In contrast to sorghum, prices of white maize in Juba have been generally much closer to import
parity prices of white maize sourced from Uganda, averaging only 6 percent below import parity prices
from January 2008 through December 2014. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between white maize
retail and import parity prices in the Juba market was 0.844. (By comparison, the correlation coefficient
between sorghum retail prices and sorghum import parity prices was only 0.720).
Enhancing Food Security through an NFSR
One major factor contributing to food insecurity in South Sudan is the absence of well-functioning
markets in most of the country due to inadequate infrastructure (roads, transport, warehousing,
telecommunications, and physical market structures) and low levels of marketed surplus. Major
institutional weaknesses, such as the lack of risk-management institutions as well as imperfect credit and
insurance markets, also hinder the efficient functioning of cereal markets. All these factors combined tend
to increase price volatility and add to risks for farmers, traders, and consumers. A well-designed NFSR
system could help mitigate the negative effects of these problems, help to protect poor households without
distorting markets, and in the medium term, contribute toward market development.
Price stabilization would not necessarily be a major objective of the NFSR system, however.
Although broad price stability has notable benefits for producers and consumers, the costs of price
stabilization often outweigh these benefits. Stable prices can benefit producers by enabling them to better
plan investments and sales. Consumers benefit by being better able to plan consumption and saving
decisions and avoid sharp losses in purchasing power and consumption that could result from large price
spikes. Yet market interventions have proven to be not only ineffective in many countries but extremely
costly as well, due to storage losses, high overhead costs, and often, mismanagement and theft.

39

In many countries public stocks have been part of relatively complex systems aimed at price
stabilization involving domestic purchases and sales of grain, usually at fixed prices. These systems
typically involve too many objectives, too many stakeholders, and too many institutions. They can also be
very expensive and entail large subsidies. Moreover, these food stock and distribution systems have often
suffered from severe governance problems and corruption that greatly inflate their costs and sharply
reduce their benefits to the intended beneficiaries.
International experience suggests that, in general, the best approach to price stabilization involves
a combination of promoting domestic and international trade, with security stocks and public imports
used on a more limited basis. A prime example is Bangladesh, where food policy involved three key
elements: public food distribution, public investment, and price incentives enabled the country to rapidly
increase domestic rice and wheat production, provide a safety net to poor households, and stabilize
markets and household access to food following major flood-induced shortfalls in domestic production.
Such a system could be designed to prevent large price spikes in times of shortage (through sales of
stocks or public imports at subsidized prices). Boosting producer prices following bumper harvests, a
more operationally difficult task requiring government purchases, likely would be feasible in South Sudan
only on a much more limited basis.
Operational Issues: Size of Stock, Stock Management, and Policy Analysis
For South Sudan, private-sector imports of maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice from Uganda are likely to be
crucial to maintain national food supplies for at least several more years. Whatever measures are taken
involving procurement and distribution of grain, South Sudan’s NFSR system should be careful to
maintain incentives for private-sector imports to avoid destabilizing market supplies and domestic prices.
To avoid problems arising from large-scale domestic procurement and sales, the NFSR system could
begin with relatively small cereal stocks (on the order of 50 to 100 thousand tons) stored in a small
number of warehouses in Juba and perhaps two to four other locations. Grain for this stock could initially
come largely from food aid or government commercial imports with distribution of the cereals through
existing targeted safety net or relief programs. Later, as domestic production increases and the national
security stock system matures, grain could increasingly be procured domestically. Such a system could be
modeled after the system of stocks and procurement (largely through imports) of Ethiopia’s PSNP, which
involves targeted distribution to a limited number of households but is not designed for market
interventions to stabilize prices.
Minimum stock levels needed can be estimated on the basis of expected monthly distribution.
Actual WFP monthly distribution of cereals in South Sudan prior to the recent civil conflict (from January
2012 through April 2013) was about 10 thousand tons of cereals per month. The stock requirement for
each month could be calculated as the average distribution of the subsequent three months (that is, a
three-period leading moving average of stocks), with an absolute minimum stock of 30 thousand tons
(based on a possible two-month lag in delivery of stocks). Under this approach, the minimum stock for
the distribution levels of 2012/2013 would rise from 30.0 thousand tons at the end of January to 53.6
thousand tons at the end of April, and then gradually decline to 32.5 thousand tons in July, before again
reaching a minimum of 30.0 thousand tons for August through December. If distribution requirements
increase, calculated minimum stock levels would increase accordingly.
In the initial years of the reserve stock, grain would be supplied mostly through imports, which
could be timed to closely mirror the stock targets. Later, when domestic procurement is a major source of
supply, stock levels would be higher than the minimum target in the months immediately following the
harvest (October and November), when procurement takes place. These relatively small stocks would not
be adequate to stabilize prices in the event of a major shock to domestic production. Instead, their purpose
would be to help ensure that enough grain would be available for limited targeted distribution programs
for the most food-insecure households and for emergency relief operations.

Implementation of the NFSR System
Implementing an NFSR system will involve more than construction of warehouses and collection of the
grain that will make up physical stocks. The NFSR requires institutions and procedures for acquiring
grain (including food aid, domestic procurement, and government commercial imports), channels for
distribution (open market sales, targeted distribution programs), and management decisions with respect
to quantity and timing of procurement and distribution.
First, a government proclamation formally creating the NFSR is needed to create an
implementing agency within government and then provide this agency with a minimum core staff for
initial operations. Second, before operations could begin, warehouses would need to be constructed or
rented. Construction of larger warehouses at a central facility (most likely near Juba) would likely be
needed within a few years of initiation of the food security stock. Third, annual procurement and
distribution plans need to be formulated. Fourth, institutional support for the system should be built
gradually over time, including a monitoring and evaluation system, early warning and crop forecasting
(initially done with the support of international organizations such as FAO and FEWS NET),
determination of stock targets, and analysis of market prices and availability. Although initially these
components would have substantial support from international donors, these institutional components and
the food and agricultural policies should be owned and run by the government.
The administrative structure of the PSNP and NSFRA in Ethiopia provides one possible model
for an NFSR system in South Sudan. This model includes a food reserve agency, governed by a board
consisting of the ministers of finance, agriculture, trade, and internal affairs, which manages the actual
food stocks, as well as a targeted safety net.
Conclusions
Grain reserves can play an important role in providing safety nets and addressing emergencies. Carefully
designed grain stocks can also stimulate production incentives. Given its missing market fundamentals,
recurring shocks, and high vulnerability, South Sudan can benefit from a well-designed NFSR system.
Nonetheless, even with functioning NFSR, promotion of private-sector domestic and import
trade will remain crucial for ensuring adequate supplies of grain. Because other countries’ experiences
suggest that a poorly designed grain reserve can be harmful to market development and production
incentives, special attention needs to be paid to the design, implementation, and evaluation of program
impacts.
Analytical and organizational capacity must also be developed so that the institutions mandated
with managing the NFSR can formulate and evaluate policies. Finally, these policies should be consistent
and transparent because uncertainty regarding government policies creates disincentives for development
of domestic markets and private-sector trade. Only if these conditions are met will an NFSR be able to
enhance food security in South Sudan.

APPENDIX A: NBHS 2009 DATA CLEANING PROCEDURES
This report used data from the 2009 Republic of South Sudan National Baseline Household Survey
(NBHS) (Republic of South Sudan, NBS 2009) to calculate descriptive statistics for cereal consumption.
The NBHS was carried out in April and May of 2009. The survey covered 4,696 households across all 10
states of South Sudan. It asked households to cite the different food items they consumed as well as to list
the quantity and value of the items consumed.
For this report, food items were divided into the following food groups: sorghum, maize, wheat,
millet, rice, other cereals, meat and fish, dairy, oils, vegetables and fruits, pulses, and other. Numbers of
consumers were calculated for each food group in each region. After these basic statistics were collected,
the data were cleaned. All households who reported neither a quantity nor a value were dropped. For
those respondents who included only a quantity, value was calculated by multiplying the median price for
the region by the quantity reported. For households who included only a value, quantity was derived
using the median quantity for similar values in each region. The calculation for value and quantity was
done separately for rural and urban areas.
Some households reported implausibly high levels of consumption of food, while other
households reported very low levels of food consumption. Cutoffs were calculated based on actual
plausible levels of consumption, and all observations beyond those cutoffs were dropped. For households
claiming very high levels of consumption, a total cereal kilogram cutoff was used. For households
claiming very low levels of consumption, a minimum spending amount was calculated per household
based on regional and urban or rural medians. Households under that threshold were dropped. Table A.1
details the households dropped.
Many households also reported abnormally high prices. For example, several households reported
prices greater than SSP 50 for different cereals while average prices were SSP 2. For each cereal, price
outliers, which were defined as those outside the median price plus two standard deviations, were
calculated, and all observations above these outliers were replaced with the median price. Different
median prices were used for rural and urban areas. After the data were cleaned, population weights were
recalculated to take into account the households dropped. At this point, the data were used to calculate
descriptive statistics on quantities of cereals consumed, budget shares, and prices.

APPENDIX B: ANALYSIS OF HOUSEHOLD DEMAND, REGRESSION RESULTS
The regression analysis used data from the Republic of South Sudan National Baseline Household Survey
(NBHS) of 2009 (Republic of South Sudan, NBS 2009). Because not every household consumed every
cereal, the two-step procedure of Heckman was used to address the censored-response problem. Before
the Heckman procedure was used, an instrumental variable for expenditure was estimated using equation
(1):

(1)

lnpcexph = idi∑b1Xih + ei,
where Xih is lnhhsize, rural, female_head, lighting, latrine, fwoodcook, room_nosleep, handpump,
head_any_educ, incomemain_crop, bicycle, radio_tv, phone, mosqnet, healthfac_acess, borrowmoney,
draughtflood. Table B.1 describes the variables used in the regression, and Tables B.2 and B.3 provide
basic descriptive statistics for the variables.
After instrumenting for total household expenditure, the first stage of Heckman was modeled
using equation (2). An inverse Mills ratio was calculated from equation (2):
Expshare_sorghumh = b1log(predexp) + b2log(predexp)2 + b3log(hhsize) +
b4(rural) + ∑b5,state5
+ ∑b6,income6h + ei.
h

(2)

The second-stage regression incorporated the computed inverse Mills ratio, IMRh, as an instrumental
variable. Equation (3) demonstrates the regression formula:
Expshare_sorgumh = b1log(predexp) + b2log(predexp)2 + b3(rural) + ∑b4,state4 {+ b5 IMRh] + ei. (3)
h

Two-step Heckman regressions were run using expenditure shares of sorghum, maize, and wheat.
The regressions were run at the national, rural, urban, north, south, rural north, rural south, other urban,
and Juba levels. Table B.3 describes the variables used in the regressions. Expenditure elasticities were
calculated using the following formula: Ehy = b1 + 2b2 log(Predexph).
The two-step Heckman procedure was also used to estimate the relationship between quantities of
cereal consumed and total expenditure. The same procedure was used but the variable expshare_sorghum
was replaced by quantity_sorghum. Once again the regressions were run for sorghum, maize, and wheat,
and for all regions. A second quantity regression was estimated that included a price variable but dropped
the squared term of predicted expenditure. Equation (4) shows the second stage of that regression. A final
regression was estimated with both price and the squared term of predicted expenditure, shown in
equation (5).
Quantity_sorghumh = b1log(predexp) + b2log(price) + b3(rural)
+ ∑b4,state4 {+ b5 IMRh] + ei

(4)

Quantity_sorghumh = b1log(predexp) + b2log(predexp)2 b3log(price) + b4(rural)
+ ∑b5,state5 {+ b6 IMRh] +ei

(5)

h

h

Own-price elasticities were calculated from the quantity regressions using this formula: ηh y= b1 + b2
2log(Predexph).
