Famine Early Warning Systems Network—Informing Climate Change Adaptation Series

A Climate Trend Analysis of Sudan
Warrap, and North Bahr el Ghazal). [Please see “Objectives and Methods” for state names and populations.]
This brief report, drawing from a multiyear effort by the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET),
identifies significant reductions in rainfall and increases
in temperature across these regions. These analyses are
based on quality-controlled station observations, climatemodel reanalyses, and land surface-model simulations.

Conclusions
• Summer rains in western and southern Sudan

have declined by 10–20 percent since the mid1970s.

• Observed warming of more than 1 degree
Celsius is equivalent to another 10–20 percent
reduction in rainfall for crops.
• The warming and drying have impacted southern Darfur and areas around Juba.
• Rainfall declines west of Juba threaten southern Sudan’s future food production prospects.
• In many cases, areas with changing climate
are coincident with zones of substantial conflict, suggesting some degree of association;
however, the contribution of climate change
to these conflicts is not currently understood.
• Rapid population growth and the expansion
of farming and pastoralism under a more
variable climate regime could dramatically
increase the number of at-risk people in Sudan
over the next 20 years.

Rainfall has Declined by 20 Percent
Between the mid-1970s and late 2000s, summer
rainfall decreased by 10–20 percent across parts of western and southern Sudan, placing already food insecure
populations at greater risk. These declines can be visualized in three ways: as a contraction of the region receiving
adequate rainfall for viable agricultural livelihoods, as a
map of anticipated changes in rainfall, and as time-series
plots of selected regions.
Sudan receives most of its rain between June and
September, and rainfall totals of more than 500 millimeters (mm) during this season typically provide enough
water for farming and livestock. Between 1960 and 1989,
the region receiving (on average) this much rain or more
was vast, over 858,000 square kilometers (km2)—an area
the size of France and the United Kingdom combined.
This region is shown in light brown in the left panel of

Food Security Context: Drying Trends in
Highly Insecure Food Areas
In 2010, approximately 8 million people faced
moderate to high levels of food insecurity in northern and
southern Sudan (Famine Early Warning Systems Network, 2010). These food insecure populations, primarily agro-pastoralists, tend to be located in western parts
of northern Sudan (Darfur and Kordofan) or in drier
portions of southern Sudan (Jonglei, East Equatoria,

the change magnitudes. South Darfur exhibits the largest
declines, followed by Blue Nile and West Equatoria.
These reductions in rainfall appear most likely to affect
the insecure areas around the cities of Al Fāshir, Nyala,
and Wāu (fig. 1).
Smoothed time series (fig. 2, middle and lower
panels, 5-year running means) of 1900–2009 rainfall, extracted for the extended Darfur region (10 to
16 degrees north, 22 to 29 degrees east) and southern
Sudan (3 to 7 degrees north, 27 to 35 degrees east), show
that 1990–2009 rainfall has been, on average, about
20 percent lower (-1 standard deviation) than rainfall
between 1900 and 1989.

figure 1 and should be understood to lie beneath the dark
brown and orange areas. Over the past 20 years, this
region has contracted (dark brown polygon), exposing
populations in Darfur, Kordofan, Upper Nile, Jonglei,
and East Equatoria to increased rainfall deficits. In the
west, this contour shifted from approximately 11 degrees
north to 10 degrees north. In the Upper Nile, the shift
was even more drastic from approximately 11 degrees
north to 9 degrees north. A third westward retraction is
occurring in Jonglei and East Equatoria, with the 500 mm
contour shifting from approximately 33 degrees east to
32 degrees east.
If present rainfall trends continue, by 2025 the drying
impacts likely will reach into West and North Bahr Al
Ghazal, Warrap, Unity, Central Equatoria, and Al Buhairat (fig. 1, orange polygon); an area with a total population of 4.1 million. The area receiving more than 500 mm
of rainfall could shrink by 249,000 km2 (30 percent of the
1960–89 area), leaving a large number of people exposed
to increased food insecurity and impacting crop production in the southeastern part of the country.
Rainfall reductions can be visualized by combining the observed 1960–2009 changes with predicted
2010–39 changes, based on persistence of the observed
trends (fig. 2, top panels). Rainfall declines range from
-150 to -50 mm across the western and southern portions
of the country, large numbers for a drought-prone country. Observed changes alone account for 63 percent of

Much Warmer Air Temperatures
Temperatures have increased by more than 1 degree
Celsius (°C) across much of central and southern Sudan.
As with rainfall, these changes can be visualized as
expansions of hot (and in this case dry) areas, as maps
of anticipated changes, or as time series. Figure 1 (right
panel) shows warming in Sudan as successive advances
of the average temperatures, represented here by the
30°C contour line. Areas of Sudan warmer than 30°C
correspond with regions of sparse vegetation and low
rainfall. These warm areas have advanced southward,

especially in the vulnerable areas surrounding Al Fāshir
and Nyala. This transition to an even warmer climate has
strong food security implications, reducing crop harvests
and pasture availability, and amplifying the impact of
droughts in this conflict torn area.
Over the past 30 years, central and southern Sudan
have been among the most rapidly warming locations on
the globe, with station temperatures increasing as much
as 0.4°C per decade. Assuming these trends persist, a
composite can be created of observed and anticipated
air temperature changes (fig. 2, top right panel). Again,
observed changes alone account for 63 percent of the
change magnitudes. The spatial pattern of warming
corresponds (broadly) with the areas associated with
reduced precipitation. Western and southern Sudan are
becoming drier and hotter, which is consistent with an
increase in atmospheric circulation bringing dry subsiding air (Please see “Objectives and Methods” section for
background information) during the main rainy season
(June–September).
Time series of air temperature data (fig. 2, middle
and lower panels, 5-year running means) show that the
magnitude of recent warming is large and unprecedented
within the past 110 years. It was estimated that the 1975
to 2009 warming was more than 1.3°C for southern
Sudan and more than 1°C within the extended Darfur
region. Given that the standard deviation of annual air
temperatures in these regions is approximately 0.5°C,
these increases represent a very large (2+ standard deviations) change from the climatic norm. Such warming,
in regions with very high average air temperatures, can
amplify the impact of water shortages on agriculture.

Under normal growing conditions, with plenty of
available water, energy from the sun causes evaporation
of water from the soil and transpiration of water vapor
from leaves. The combination of these two flows of water
vapor is called evapotranspiration. Year-to-year variations
in evapotranspiration are strongly related to changes in
plant growth, cereal formation and filling, end-of-season
yields, and pasture biomass. Increasing air temperatures,
especially in very warm regions, can reduce evapotranspiration. As already high temperatures rise, the environment becomes less hospitable to plants. These warming
effects can combine with decreases in rainfall to reduce
evapotranspiration and crop yield. Over the past 20 years,
declines in evapotranspiration (fig. 3) are larger for the
extended Darfur region (approximtely -40 percent) and
southern Sudan (approximately -28 percent) than the
associated decreases in rainfall (approximately -10 percent). Temperature impacts appear to be amplifying the
effects of drought.

Darfur region and the southern Sudan region.

While limitations inherent in the available data and
models make all the estimates uncertain, both simple
plots based on available station data (fig. 2) and results
from sophisticated land-surface models (fig. 3) tell a
similar story; western and southern Sudan are experiencing substantially warmer and drier weather, and the
combination of these effects is reducing evapotranspiration and producing more frequent droughts.

Convergence of Evidence
The results presented here point to a convergence
of evidence among multiple datasets. The station-based
analyses of rainfall and temperature show large departures from normal, with both drier and warmer conditions in western and southern Sudan. Further evidence of
these observed changes comes from nearby southwestern
Ethiopia. FEWS NET has analyzed observations from
Ethiopian rain gage stations, and these studies reveal
similar trends (see section “Objectives and Methods”).
In addition, the evapotranspiration data come from
another independent source—land-surface model results
downloaded from the Global Land Data Assimilation
System. All results point to substantial recent drying and
warming.

Some Implications for Food Security and
Adaptation
The data shown here depict drying trends in one of
the world’s most food insecure regions. The extended
Darfur region and southern Sudan have experienced considerable rainfall declines since the 1960–89 period. The
dryness in the south is consistent with previous FEWS
NET studies (see section “Objectives and Methods”)
identifying large declines in June–September rainfall
in southern Ethiopia. A -1 standard deviation decline in
rainfall (close to -20 percent) is sufficient to markedly
increase the number of expected poor harvests. Increasingly frequent droughts might be offset by improved
water- and agricultural-management practices, and raising yields in wetter areas may be a more viable option
than extending agriculture into more marginal areas. In
both cases, however, rapid population growth may make
it difficult to slow the process of agricultural extensification into marginal areas.
Since 1980, decreasing rainfall has been accompanied
by rapid increases in air temperature on the order of more
than 1°C. This warming, which is two and a half times
greater than global warming, is reducing evapotranspiration and making normal years effectively drier, especially
in the extended Darfur and southern Sudan regions.

Objectives and Methods
The FEWS NET Informing Climate Change Adaptation series seeks to guide adaptation efforts by providing
high quality subnational analyses of recently observed
climate trends. For development and food security decision makers, knowing whether these observed trends are

The Climate Change and Conflict Link
A lively debate exists about the nature and strength of a presumed link between climate change and
conflict in Sudan. This is especially true about Darfur, where the central role of natural resources in
a high-profile conflict dynamic are well-established, and climate change is often assumed to be a key
cause. At the usual national or subnational scale of studies of this climate change and conflict link, the
debate most often centers on fairly coarse resolution pictures of the livelihoods involved in the conflict
(pastoralists and farmers) and the specific local expressions of the climate change conceived to be driving the conflict (warmer and drier). Applying coarse, dimensionless patterns of climate stress to a broad
and overly generalized picture of the human livelihoods may fail to provide a rigorous analytic structure
to inform the global debate on the threats and impacts of climate change and actionable insights on climate-related adaptive measures that could be useful in conflict-affected areas such as Darfur. In Southern
Sudan, the conflict seems to become increasingly apparent in Warrap, the Lakes area, and near the border
between Ironstone and the western flood plains.
The “upscaled” and nationally-derived climate change information provided here, allied with the
high-resolution livelihood information already available for Sudan, offers a potentially rich new opportunity. By observing and assessing the actual and expected future interactions of climate change with
highly resolved pictures of livelihood-related grievances and forces promoting conflict in specific communities, emergent conflict areas may be better identified.
