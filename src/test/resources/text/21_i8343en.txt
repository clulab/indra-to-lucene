“In today’s global context of unprecedented humanitarian needs and increasing frequency of large scale natural disasters, anticipating and mitigating
crises has never been more critical. The Early Warning - Early Action initiative has been developed with the understanding that disaster losses
and emergency response costs can be drastically reduced by using early warning analysis to act before a crisis escalates into an emergency.
Early actions strengthen the resilience of at-risk populations, mitigate the impact of disasters and help communities, governments and national
and international humanitarian agencies to respond more effectively and efficiently”
José Graziano da Silva
FAO Director-General

Background
The Global Early Warning – Early Action (EWEA) report on food security and agriculture is
developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The report
is part of FAO’s EWEA system, which aims to translate forecasts and early warnings into
anticipatory action.
EWEA enables FAO to act early before disasters have happened and to mitigate or even
prevent their impact. By lessening damages to livelihoods and protecting assets and
investments, FAO can help local livelihoods become more resilient to threats and crises while,
where possible, addressing their root causes.
The Global EWEA report is a quarterly forward-looking analytical summary of major disaster
risks to food security and agriculture. The report specifically highlights two types of contexts:
➤➤ potential new emergencies caused by imminent disaster threats; and
➤➤ the risk of a significant deterioration in countries currently in a situation of protracted
crisis or already in the response stage of an emergency, with a severe impact on
food security and/or agriculture. For this kind of risk, the analysis will focus on the
additional risk factors, which would, either alone or in combination with others, lead
to a substantial deterioration of the situation.

The report’s summary is rooted in the analysis provided by existing FAO corporate and
joint multi-agency information and early warning systems, mainly:
➤➤ Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS);
➤➤ Food Chain Crisis and Emergency Prevention System (FCC-EMPRES); and
➤➤ Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) and Cadre Harmonise (CH).
Additional corporate information and external sources were also consulted for the
development of this report. A detailed list is available on page 27.
Through a consensus-based process, countries have been indicated as “high risk”
when there is a very likely new emergency or deterioration of the current situation with
potentially severe effects on agriculture and food security, and in which FAO and partners
should start implementing early actions on a no-regret basis. Countries listed as “on
watch” instead have a moderate to high likelihood of a new emergency or deterioration
of the current situation, with potentially moderate or significant impacts on agriculture
and food security. An overview of the risk ranking methodology is provided on page 5.

Countries affected by protracted crises or already in the response stage of an emergency,
where there are limited signs of a significant deterioration, are not included in the report.
However, an overview of countries with humanitarian response plans or emergency
plans is provided on page 28.

Methodology

1. Shortlisting countries flagged by the corporate early warning systems, IPC and CH
through core publications and alerts.
2. Triangulation of information on countries and regions at risk from other datasets and
external early warning systems.
3. Consolidation of information from corporate and external early warning systems.
4. Final vetting and ranking of countries and regions at risk.
The final vetting and ranking of countries is carried out by the focal point group, making
use of the following criteria:
➤➤ Likelihood of occurrence is classified into five levels (very unlikely, unlikely,
moderately likely, likely and very likely). The term likelihood applies to the probability
that, within the time period considered, either a new disaster risk or the significant
deterioration of the situation will occur.
➤➤ Potential impact is ranked into five levels (negligible, minor, moderate, severe and
critical). The impact is analysed through two dimensions, in terms of magnitude
(the number of potentially affected people and/or geographical extent of the impact
on agriculture and people’s livelihoods and food security) and severity (the gravity
of the impact on agriculture and people’s livelihoods and food security, especially
in relation to pre-existing vulnerability and food insecurity).
➤➤ Country capacity to cope with and respond to potential disasters or deteriorated
situations is also classified into five levels (very low, low, medium, high and very
high). Lack of coping capacity, one of the Index for Risk Management’s (INFORM)
dimensions, is used as a reference.

HIGH FAO and partners should start implementing early actions on a
no-regrets basis. Inclusion in the report under the High Risk category.

RISK VALUE

The most at-risk countries and regions are selected through a consultative process led
by the early warning system focal points group. The group also serves as the report’s key
source of information (as outlined in the list of sources section). The main steps of the
methodology are the following:

MEDIUM FAO should strengthen corporate monitoring,

preparedness and plan for the implementation of certain low cost early
actions. Inclusion in the report under the On Watch category.

LOW Continue with Monitoring of risk/country.
No inclusion in the report.

In a context where a new emergency or the further deterioration of the situation might
lead to an increased risk of famine, or when the occurrence of famine has been declared,
this aspect is particularly highlighted in the cover map and narrative of the report with
respectively two categories: “Risk of famine” and “Famine declared”.

Recommendations for early actions
Early action recommendations, indicated for each risk, aim to briefly outline some
of the most appropriate interventions over the coming months which could prevent,
mitigate or prepare for the potential impact of a specific disaster on the agriculture
sector and livelihoods. Recommendations are therefore sector specific and non-binding
in nature. Early actions can vary from interventions aiming to protect livelihood assets
to planning and preparatory activities. Recommendations are developed by FAO through
a consultative process involving technical experts and FAO country, sub-regional and
regional offices.

The three criteria are inserted in a risk matrix which determines the final result of the
risk evaluation.

Risk of famine due to accessibility restrictions
and further disease outbreaks

Risk overview

HIGH RISK

Potential impact

➤➤ If disruption to humanitarian access continues, a further deterioration in already the largest humanitarian crisis
in the world is expected. In a worst-case scenario, those most vulnerable could suffer famine-like conditions
(IPC Phase 5). The Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) estimates that more than 10.4 million people
are likely to be severely food insecure if access restrictions continue.
➤➤ With poor access to life-saving medicines and clean water, disease outbreaks are likely to worsen. The International
Committee of the Red Cross has warned that an estimated 1 million people are at risk of contracting cholera
by early 2018. Cases of diphtheria are also spreading, with over 1 million children currently at risk.

➤➤ Yemen faces further deterioration due to a blockade imposed on critical imports and disease epidemics.
The worst affected areas were reported in the southern and western part of the country.
➤➤ The blockade on air, sea and land entry points, imposed on 6 November 2017, stalled the flow of essential
supplies to 27 million people. As of July 2017, an estimated 17 million people are in food security Crisis
(IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4). In December, the Humanitarian Needs Overview estimated this
had increased to 17.8 million people. While the methodologies of these assessments differ, they reveal food
insecurity levels are increasing.
➤➤ Yemen is reliant on maritime imports for around 80 percent of its food needs. Nearly three weeks into
the blockade, ports of entry began to receive humanitarian shipments. On 28 November, a World Food
Programme (WFP) vessel carrying 25 000 tonnes of wheat arrived at Saleef port. Domestic agricultural
production has decreased due to below-average rainfall, limited inputs and high prices. Domestic cereal
production in 2017 is forecasted at 335 000 tonnes, about half of the five-year average.
➤➤ Shipments carrying medicine also landed at Sana’a airport, delivering an estimated 1.9 million cholera
vaccines. As of December 2017, more than 979 000 suspected cholera cases and 2 200 deaths were reported.
With transport routes compromised, efforts to control the epidemic are being reversed. In particular, Sa’ada,
Taiz and Al Hudaydah governorates have run out of clean water, as the blockade halted critical fuel inputs
to pump water. These conditions have also ignited a diphtheria outbreak. Some 318 suspected cases and
28 deaths have been reported since mid-August.

Recommended early actions

To address the risk of famine in the worst-case scenario, access to
vulnerable communities is urgently required to support humanitarian efforts.
If restrictions are lifted and access is granted, the following actions are
recommended:
•• enhance emergency livelihood support activities in particular to support
backyard income-generating activities and food production;
•• safeguard pastoralist assets by enabling access to livestock vaccinations,
health treatments and restocking;
•• initiate cash-for-work activities to generate income and support
agricultural value chains;
•• support the reinstatement of social safety net programmes and policies
to reduce unemployment and support livelihoods;
•• in addition, it is important continue monitoring the quantities of wheat,
rice and fuel entering the country, as well as price developments;
•• launch second round of the FSAC-led famine risk monitoring in January
2018 for all high priority districts; and
•• improve national early warning systems by: (i) strengthening agro-climatic
monitoring; (ii) enhancing capacity for data collection, management and
climate analysis of national institutions; and (iii) designing appropriate
communication/dissemination strategies.

Risk overview

➤➤ Rohingya refugees are likely to continue crossing the border into Bangladesh due to persistent conflict and food
access restrictions. An estimated 100 000 additional people are expected to arrive over the next six months.
➤➤ As the dry season continues, water issues will persist in refugee settlements. Disease outbreaks, including AWD
and diphtheria, will likely remain high, thereby compounding existing food and nutrition vulnerabilities.

LIKELIHOOD

To avoid further deterioration of food security and nutrition during January–
March 2018, the following actions are recommended:
•• support home production and micro-gardening efforts among refugee
populations where possible;
•• supply refugee households with safe food storage equipment to prevent
infestations and food-borne illnesses;
•• train women groups in energy-saving cooking measures and use of
efficient stoves;
•• undertake cash-for-work activities to address environmental degradation,
land stabilization and erosion control in areas where water sources,
population security and agricultural lands are threatened; and
•• form agro-forestry and collaborative forest management farming
systems, and plant fast-growing fuelwood plants, tree nurseries and
seedlings;
For communities remaining in Rakhine State:
•• distribute agricultural inputs to increase availability of fresh food to communities;
•• support the establishment of aquaculture systems and poultry units to
increase availability of protein rich food; and
•• undertake cash transfer activities to rebuild productive infrastructures.

➤➤ Violence in Rakhine State has led to widespread destruction of villages and livelihoods. The spread of conflict
has instigated large displacements of Rohingya people to Bangladesh, while the remaining population in
Rakhine State face food access constraints. As of 19 December 2017, over 655 000 Rohingya refugees have
fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted on 25 August. Most refugees have sought shelter in Cox’s Bazar
and its upazilas. In these areas, an estimated 7.5 percent of children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.
➤➤ In October 2017, an assessment carried out by Relief International and International Rescue Committee
highlighted that 77 percent of households adopted negative coping mechanisms in Cox’s Bazar due to food
insecurity. Negative coping mechanisms included relying on less expensive foods (90 percent), reducing the
number of daily meals (69 percent) and restricting adult consumption (68 percent).
➤➤ An estimated 60 percent of drinking water in refugee camps is contaminated. Since 25 August, more than
36 000 Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) cases were reported, including 10 deaths. With the dry season
(November/December) progressing, tube wells were dug shallower and poor hygiene practices have
exacerbated the spread of disease.
➤➤ High population density in refugee camps has overwhelmed existing facilities. Congestion has resulted in
limited land space for refugees and adoption of survival mechanisms – i.e. the collection of firewood, has
degraded the local environment. Due to the scare resources, increased tensions between host communities
and Rohingya refugees have been reported.
➤➤ In Rakhine State, authorities have reportedly closed village markets and limited food transport routes.
Humanitarian organizations continue to face access constraints in Northern and Central Rakhine.
As of November 2017, Myanmar and Bangladesh have signed an agreement for the possible repatriation of
Rohingya refugees to Rakhine state. However, the eligibility criteria and location remain unclear.

Recommended early actions

HIGH RISK

To curb the increasing risk of famine, access to communities is essential to
address basic needs and support their livelihoods. FAO recommends the
following actions:
•• invest in networks of community-based animal health workers to support
livestock health services;
•• provide veterinary services to pastoralists, focusing on endemic
and infectious diseases like foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine
pleuropneumonia, haemorrhaegic septicaemia and East Coast fever;
•• support the distribution of fuel-efficient cooking stoves – particularly to
women – to reduce tensions over the exploitation of natural resources;
•• support measures to mitigate FAW infestation, including trainings
through farmer field schools; and
•• support local negotiations for livestock migration routes and grazing
rights.

Potential impact

From January to March 2018, the food security situation is projected to deteriorate unseasonably with the lean
season expected three months earlier than normal. This will result in an estimated 5.1 million (48 percent of
the total population) people being classified as severely food insecure in January - March 2018, with 20 000
remaining in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).
The key harvest season from November to January has been severely affected by the conflict. Food access will
remain constrained due to hyperinflation and poorly functioning markets.
In a worst-case scenario, the combination of climatic shocks, humanitarian access constraints, and macroeconomic instability will likely result in the risk of famine-like conditions (IPC Phase 5) in multiple areas as the
country heads towards the peak of the lean season in 2018.

[January – March]
Critical

Risk of famine due to armed conflict

➤➤ Conflict has progressively spread across the country, disrupting access for both the local population and
humanitarian actors. The distribution of humanitarian assistance is becoming increasingly difficult since the
conflict has curtailed key transportation routes.
➤➤ Despite the recent main season harvests, the number of people currently facing severe food insecurity has
not decreased significantly from 6 million (56 percent of the total population) in September to 4.8 million
(45 percent of the total population) in October-December. Most concerning, 25 000 people still face
Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) levels.
➤➤ Acute malnutrition levels has worsened compared with October 2016. Malnutrition rates in most communities
are well above the emergency threshold of 15 percent, with populations in Renk, Twic and Wau counties
experiencing extreme critical levels of acute malnutrition (>30 percent) among children under five.
➤➤ The expected seasonal respite due to the ongoing harvest will be minimal in conflict-affected areas, where
households are likely to harvest less than three months of cereal. In addition, the fall armyworm (FAW) might
further reduce crop production.
➤➤ The conflict is driving continued large-scale displacements, particularly of farming households from the
country’s greenbelt. The number of people displaced since the start of the conflict in 2013 has reached more
than 4 million, including 1.9 million internally and more than 2 million to neighbouring countries.
➤➤ Food prices are significantly higher. The retail price of sorghum, maize and wheat flour have increased by up
to 281 percent compared to October 2016.

in the country and the recent violent events against the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo soldiers further compounded the situation.
➤➤ As of November 2017, there are 4.1 million internally displaced people (IDPs), of which 2 million in the Kasai
and Tanganyika provinces and 1 million in North and South Kivu. The majority of the IDPs live with host
families, many of whom are already experiencing food insecurity and chronic poverty.
➤➤ The food security situation remains severe. About 7.7 million people face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency
(IPC Phase 4) levels, representing 11 percent of the rural population.
➤➤ According to the last IPC analysis in June 2017, 12 territories of Lomani, Kasaï Oriental, Kasaï Central, Kasaï,
Sankuru, Tanganyika, Ituri and Maniema provinces face Emergency conditions (IPC Phase 4). In these areas,
affected households mainly depending on agriculture for their subsistence have seen their land and fields
burned and looted, thereby losing a great portion of their crops.
➤➤ As stated by FAO GIEWS, average to below-average 2017 season crops are therefore at national levels due
to increasing violence as well as other compounding factors including erratic rainfall in some parts of the
country and the spread of FAW.
➤➤ The local currency has depreciated significantly against the US dollar over the past months, resulting in more
expensive and therefore reduced imports from neighbouring countries. Consequently, a significant upward
pressure on domestic food and livestock supplies and prices was registered. In the Tanganyika province,
cross-border flows from Tanzania resulted in a doubling of local prices of maize and cassava.

Recommended early actions

Taking into account contextual diversities, access constraints and conflict
sensitivity, coordinated and need-based actions should focus on reinforcing
and restoring local livelihoods and market access in an effort to contribute
to sustainable peace and reconciliation. Among the various options, priority
actions should be to:
•• support short-cycle vegetable production (promote the use of certified
seeds and quality inputs) and nutrition-sensitive agriculture to
increase the consumption of nutrient-rich foods for the displaced, host
communities and returnees;
•• support livestock production (specific for children and women such as
guinea pigs, poultry, etc.); and
•• support kitchen garden techniques to enable production, where there is
no access to land plots.

Potential impact

➤➤ With the well-below average harvests from previous growing seasons in the Kasaï and Tanganyika provinces,
households are expected to deplete their food stocks by January and experience a prolonged lean season.
➤➤ The main agricultural growing season “A”, with harvests expected from January to March 2018, will continue
being affected by the conflict and FAW infestation in some parts of the country, including Nord Kivu and
Katanga, further hindering food availability in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Risk overview

Potential impact

➤➤ The current widespread food insecurity is driven by consecutive poor rains and harvests that led to well
below-average production and large-scale livestock losses, reducing access to food and income.
➤➤ Rainfall during the deyr season has been erratically distributed and below average in many areas. As a result,
crop production is expected to be 70-80 percent below the average.
➤➤ According to climate experts, drought conditions are likely to persist in the Horn of Africa from April to June,
potentially leading to below-average 2018 gu season (April–June). If the forecast materialises, millions of
rural Somalis face the prospect of a fifth consecutive below-average season.
➤➤ In the absence of assistance, many pastoral households in worst-hit areas would be forced to sell their
remaining livestock to purchase cereal at very high prices, especially during the first quarter of 2018.
➤➤ Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains a possible outcome in the worst-affected areas in 2018, including areas where
humanitarian access is limited or impeded due to Al-Shabaab activity.
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Rome, 2018

Recommended early actions

The continuation of scaled-up humanitarian assistance to prevent a slide
towards famine in high-risk areas is critical. The following activities are
recommended for the upcoming jilaal season (January–March) – Somalia’s
driest period:
•• scale up cash-based assistance to increase income and food access;
•• provide emergency livestock support to keep animals alive and productive
(i.e. vaccination, treatment, feed and fodder supplements, water tanks
and water trucking, as appropriate);
•• protect and restore households’ own food production while meeting
immediate needs, through the:
•• provision of seeds and training in time for farmers and agropastoralists to plant during the 2017 gu season;
•• pastoral support (mineral blocks, milk containers, livestock deworming)
to improve animal health and milk production; and
•• provision of riverine fishing kits (hooks, lines, fishing weights, knives,
solar-powered torch, cooler, chopping board and solar-powered
fridges); and
•• support FAW preparedness and response initiatives (community
surveillance and early warning, mass awareness campaigns, training and
emergency control measures).

HIGH RISK

➤➤ The risk of famine in Somalia persists, with 3.3 million people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency
(IPC Phase 4) levels through the end of 2017. Sustained humanitarian assistance has prevented more
extreme outcomes in some areas, yet persistent drought threatens the recovery of livelihoods and a further
deterioration of food security into 2018.
➤➤ As a result of La Niña-like conditions, rains at the start and peak of the deyr season (October–December)
were erratic and approximately 50 percent below average in most areas, despite additional November
rains modestly improving crop, pasture and water conditions. In northern pastoral areas, pasture and water
resources were below average.
➤➤ In the two major crop producing regions of Bay and Shabelle, there were light to moderate rains in late
September/early October and in November.
➤➤ Drought conditions throughout the year have severely impacted the livestock sector, leading to distress sales
and livestock deaths, greatly reducing average herd sizes. Furthermore, livestock births and milk production
remain low in most parts of the country. Livestock recovery will require several seasons of good rainfall to
recover.
➤➤ Although drought conditions have severely affected agro-pastoral livelihoods, farmers who benefitted from
livelihood assistance were able to cope better and incur lower losses.

Recommended early actions

To protect vulnerable livelihoods from the impact of the prolonged drought,
the following activities are recommended for the January–March period:
•• emergency livestock support including provision of feed, water and
veterinary care for the recovery of weakened and core-breeding livestock;
•• support quick growing fodder and feed production in reliably irrigated
areas;
•• implement cash-for-work programmes to rehabilitate water sources,
establish spate irrigation schemes for fodder production, where possible
and provide people with the means to procure food;
•• provide unconditional cash, combined with in-kind productive assets and
training (“Cash+”) to meet immediate needs and restore livelihoods;
and
•• implement flood mitigation interventions based on the results from the
flood mapping exercise.

HIGH RISK

➤➤ With the onset of La Niña-like conditions, the short rains (October–December) have been below average and
erratic, failing completely in some areas, especially in southern and southeastern pastoral areas of Ethiopia and
eastern Kenya.
➤➤ In Ethiopia, prolonged drought conditions are severely affecting the livelihoods in most southern and
southeastern pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region, southern
Oromia and southeastern Somali Regions, where cumulative seasonal rainfall was up to 60 percent below
average. In these areas, pasture and water availability have declined to extremely low levels, severely affecting
crop production and livestock conditions, leading to large scale animal deaths.
➤➤ In northern and eastern Kenya, reduced supply of staple crops and livestock products, coupled with access
constrains due to high food prices lead to high levels of malnutrition (with over 30 percent of children under
five showing signs of wasting in the worst affected areas). As of August 2017, 2.6 million people face Crisis
(IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions, which is double the amount compared with the same
time last year.
➤➤ While those displaced by drought earlier in the year have largely returned to their traditional grazing areas in
Ethiopia, many have returned following a significant loss of livestock. Likewise, conflict between Oromia and
Somali Regions in Ethiopia has also caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in the two
regions.
➤➤ FAW has affected the previous agricultural seasons in both countries, with Kenya reporting the pest in 40 out
of the 47 counties.

in southeastern Ethiopia, will be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), while some households will be in Catastrophe
(IPC Phase 5) through May 2018.
➤➤ The poor rains in the two countries will limit pasture regeneration and water availability. In turn, this will affect
milk production, which could lead to a potential spike of malnutrition in children.
➤➤ FAW is likely to affect the short cropping season and possibly the 2018 long rains season.

➤➤ According to the latest Cadre Harmonisé (CH) analysis published in November 2017, the number of people facing
Crisis, Emergency and Famine conditions (CH Phases 3, 4 and 5) in the three states in 2017 has decreased from
5.2 million people in June–August to about 2.6 million people in October–December. This was mainly due to
improved security conditions, which allowed humanitarian access and the recovery of livelihood activities, coupled
with favourable national crop prospects, a slight improvement of trade and markets and the ongoing large-scale
humanitarian assistance.
➤➤ Notwithstanding the improvements, the three northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa still account for
more than 80 percent of the entire acutely food insecure population in Nigeria.
➤➤ Despite the four percent decrease in internal displacements since June, food insecurity remains particularly high
within IDP populations, of which 68 percent face significant food access constraints.
➤➤ Harvests between September and December are expected to be well below average due to widespread insecurity
and limited area for cultivation.

Recommended early actions

To improve the resilience of the affected population, enhancing agricultural
productivity is critical. The current priorities are as follows:
•• provide critical means for food production and livelihood restoration to
host communities, returnees and IDPs with access to land through the:
•• distribution of fertilizers and vegetable and rice seeds to support the dry
season, as well as millet, sorghum, maize and pulse seeds in preparation
for the main cropping season from May 2018; and
•• provision of training to farmers in crop production, post-harvest
management and handling techniques.
•• restore the livelihoods of the most vulnerable households, including
women-headed households through small ruminants and poultry
restocking.

Potential impact

➤➤ The food security and nutrition situation remains extremely fragile despite the improvements. Without continued

humanitarian food and livelihood assistance in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States, 3.7 million people will likely be at
risk of critical food insecurity in 2018.
➤➤ The Boko Haram insurgency might continue in Borno, northern Adamawa, and parts of Yobe States. Although
some returns were registered during the past months, further population displacement is likely if attacks continue,
particularly with the start of the dry season.
➤➤ Very limited staple harvests, high food prices and limited labour opportunities will likely increase dependency on
humanitarian assistance for many poor households in the northeast.

reduced critical wheat and fodder stocks essential for the winter and lean season.
➤➤ According to the latest IPC analysis (August–November 2017), more than 5.7 million people were estimated to be
in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 1.9 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). This represents a decrease compared with
the 8.4 million people facing the same conditions between April and June 2016. However, the decrease is mainly
attributable to the post-harvest food availability.
➤➤ Estimates indicate that the wheat production is 16 percent below the five-year average. In some areas, this is the third
poor consecutive season. In the central highlands, including Bamyan and Ghor provinces, availability of pasture and
fodder for livestock has decreased.
➤➤ The intensification of the conflict further compounded the current situation, leading to a new wave of internal
displacements and leaving a substantial part of the affected people without access to livelihoods. According to the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), over 73 000 new IDPs have been recorded between
October and November.
➤➤ The staggering economy as well as the poor agricultural season impact the labour market and wages, subsequently
preventing many IDPs from finding work and meeting their basic needs. Women-headed households are especially
affected, as they face access issues and are restricted to low-paid employment.

unfavourably impacted by the low distribution and timing of the March–April rains, potentially leading to low harvest
prospects. This is especially concerning for areas that have experienced several consecutive years of drought.
➤➤ The intensification of the conflict also increases people’s food insecurity due to the disruption of trade and livelihoods.
New IDPs and returnees, who have lost their sources of income, are among the most vulnerable groups.

The following early actions are recommended to support Syrian farmers with
access to land to aid with the recovery of livelihoods:
•• provide inputs to support agriculture-based livelihoods through backyard

•• rehabilitate damaged infrastructure particularly irrigation, through cashbased interventions, where the security situation allows; and
•• establish village-based private seed production and distribution centres
to supplement limited governmental distribution.

Potential impact

➤➤ The food security situation in Syria has been severely impacted by prolonged conflict, which is likely to further

exacerbate or delay access to vulnerable communities – particularly in besieged or hard-to-reach areas where
aid is limited. If aid becomes increasingly restricted, the only way to reach those in need would be to intercept
conflict frontlines, which will further endanger both humanitarian agencies and vulnerable communities. Overall,
humanitarian access to northeast Syria will likely remain unpredictable throughout 2018.

➤➤ Despite the rainy season (June/October) resulting in above-average or average rainfall for the majority of Sudan, the
situation in Kassala has become increasingly concerning from July 2017 onwards. The state received below-average
rainfall ranging from 60 to 80 percent, with some localities reporting dry spells lasting 20 to 25 days.
➤➤ As a result of dry conditions, planting was late and well below-average in Kassala. According to the inter-agency midseason assessment, confirmed by the Crop Food Security Assessment Mission preliminary findings, the area planted
for sorghum was 50 to 60 percent below average in Kassala state due to shortage of rainfall.
➤➤ As of September 2017, sorghum prices in Kassala have risen 15 percent per month and surpassed the national
average of SDG $3.9 per kg.
➤➤ According to the Sudanese Food Security Technical Secretariat (FSTS), 2017/2018 fodder reserve stocks sit at
3.7 million tonnes, which are insufficient for the states’ needs. As a result, stocks are expected to run out by
January 2018.
➤➤ Critical water supplies (mainly hackers and hods) are expected to dry up by the end of December 2017. The lack of
both resources present serious concerns as the state enters the dry season. Poor or deteriorating livestock conditions
have been reported in localised areas, consequently decreasing market prices.

Potential impact

➤➤ From January to July 2018, the Sudanese FSTS estimated the increase of the fodder gap to more than 7.9 million

tonnes. Therefore, ensuring the depletion of livestock feeding resources earlier than usual. This could potentially drive
an early livestock lean season in February or March 2018, two months earlier than usual.
➤➤ In addition, below-average sorghum cropping season will result in low harvests affecting food security.

This would likely generate an increase in feed prices and may lead to market shocks in the affected areas. Further,
decrease of livestock prices will affect herders’ purchasing power.

Recommended early actions

In close coordination with existing long-term initiatives, all actions should
address the root causes of such crisis and with the participation of pastoral
organisations. Therefore, the recommended actions are as follows:
•• support the mapping of available resources (pasture, surface water and
borehole water availability);
•• assist countries and pastoralist communities to safely manage
transhumance movements of livestock at critical points in order to
minimize risk of conflicts;
•• support early offtake and destocking activities through cash payments or
vouchers for feed or veterinary services;
•• emergency livestock support including provision of feed, water and
veterinary care to save weakened and core-breeding livestock;
•• support quick growing fodder and feed production in reliably irrigated
areas; and
•• implement cash-for-work programmes to rehabilitate water sources,
establish spate irrigation schemes for fodder production (where possible)
and fire prevention of limited available pasture, and provide people the
means to procure food;

Recommended early actions

To support the most affected communities to restore their livelihoods and
ensure their access to food, the following actions are recommended:
•• provide livelihood support (e.g. home gardening, poultry, tuber crops –
sweet potatoes, cassava) to both IDPs and host communities to improve
food security, strengthen food production capacity and gain access to
some revenues;
•• during the dry season, support the rehabilitation of infrastructure (postharvest storage, value chain transformation small equipment (e.g.
mills), livestock, market facilities, etc.) and ensure animal health better
coverage (especially basic immunizations); and
•• support and strengthen existing dialogue platforms between pastoralists
and farmers to reduce conflict prior to livestock migration season.

a result of violent clashes between armed groups. This has heavily affected livelihood activities, causing an increase in
humanitarian needs while at the same time limiting humanitarian access.
➤➤ Although the last IPC report in February 2017 indicated that 1.1 million people faced Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and
Emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions, trends indicate limited and poor food consumption and reduced household
coping capacity. The crisis the country is experiencing since 2013 has led to the displacement of more than 600 000
people internally and forced more than 500 000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
➤➤ The new escalation in the conflict has particularly ignited tensions between farmers and pastoralists, since livestock
is mainly confined to localized areas due to insecurity, especially affecting transhumance herding and the livestock
sector as a whole.
➤➤ Unfavourable 2017 crop production prospects are expected due the decline in planted areas as a consequence of
persisting civil unrest.
➤➤ In addition, livestock and imported food prices are well above average due to difficulties in transportation.
➤➤ Insecurity has also threatened humanitarian interventions, leading to the relocation of 241 workers from conflict
areas in January–September 2017. The reduced presence of humanitarian agencies and partners impacts the delivery
of vital assistance.

Negligible

Potential impact

➤➤ The January–March period marks the livestock migration period, hence intensified hostilities between pastoralists

and farmers is very likely. The same period coincides with the migration and labour demand peak, with conflict likely
to hamper income-generating activities.
➤➤ Ongoing conflicts will continue to affect food security outcomes in the northwestern, southeastern and central
part of the country, especially in Basse Kotto, Haute Kotto, Haut Mbomou, Mbomou, Nana Mambéré and Ouham
Pende. Affected households in these areas are likely to experience reduced harvests for the fifth consecutive year, low
livestock production prospects, as well as limited access to humanitarian assistance. Therefore, they are expected to
continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions or worse.

rangelands. The situation could deteriorate with an elevated risk of severe winter conditions known as dzud, which
threatens the livelihoods of Mongolian herders in central and western parts of the country.
➤➤ Extreme high temperatures affected 80 percent of rangelands in mid-2017. The situation deteriorated further when
a short spurt of above-average rains in August damaged key wheat crops just before the harvest. Depending on the
area, wheat production is between 30 to 70 percent below average.
➤➤ The September harvest is critical for the country’s economy and building up fodder reserves. However, the current
Pasture Carrying Capacity (PCC) is low, with 40 percent of rangelands moderately or heavily overgrazed and a further
35 percent lightly overgrazed. Mongolia’s total PCC currently stands at 35 million heads of livestock, however the
country has over 61.5 million heads of livestock.
➤➤ The poor availability of feed has resulted in below-average livestock conditions. Due to the limited grazing capacity,
livestock were not able to develop critical stores of fat to survive the winter. The preparation of hay and fodder by
herders is 48 percent at district level and security reserves at a province level rests at 27 percent. Reserves only last
until the end of 2017.
➤➤ The value of meat and dairy on the retail market has also decreased. The oversupply of livestock is a result of herders
selling for cash to purchase fodder reserves. Prices of meat products were reportedly 20 to 30 percent compared with
the October 2016 average.
➤➤ On 10 November 2017, the Government of Mongolia released a dzud risk map, revealing that 30 percent of the
country is at very high risk of dzud and 30 percent with medium risk.

Recommended early actions

To support livestock throughout the winter season, the following actions
should be considered:
•• preposition hay and fodder feed to support livestock survival;
•• support vulnerable herder households with benign hay and concentrate;
•• provide fodder with a high content of proteins, vitamins and minerals,
particularly for pregnant livestock or yearlings; and
•• strengthen livestock disease surveillance and control operations,
particularly for FMD.

Potential impact

➤➤ Even if a mild dzud forms, the poor performance of the main growing season raises elevated concerns for the winter

months. The combination of below-average livestock conditions coupled with poor feed reserves compromises
livestock’s ability to survive the winter. Such conditions expose livestock to hyperthermia and starvation.
Early estimates signal that 161 000 herder-households will be impacted.
➤➤ Reports have highlighted deficit of over 405 000 tonnes of hay and 23 000 tonnes of animal fodder is required to
support herders through the winter months. To make up for this deficit, the Government has pledged to import fodder.
However, vulnerable herders will unlikely have the means to purchase this feed.

Risk overview

➤➤ The Fall Armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda) is an insect native to the Americas, which has the potential to

Potential impact

➤➤ Due to its potential to fly long distances and through trade, FAW is a dangerous transboundary pest with a high

probability to infest additional countries. The detection of the pest in Sudan raises an alarm for Egypt. Farmers will
need great support to sustainably manage FAW.
➤➤ A recent estimate from the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International indicates that if the FAW is not well
managed, it could cause a possible 21 to 53 percent annual maize loss in 12 maize producing African countries,
corresponding to an estimated 8.3 to 20.6 million tonnes loss of maize per year worth between USD 2.48–6.18 billion.
➤➤ Considering FAW does not only feed on maize but also affects other crops, the potential impact might be even greater
than the given estimates.
➤➤ The majority (98 percent) of maize farmers in Africa are smallholder farmers for whom reduced maize harvests would
lead to a decrease in their food security. Areas exposed to drought are especially vulnerable since crops with low
moisture become less resilient and therefore are exponentially more liable to the pest. This puts the already drought
prone vulnerable communities at an even greater risk.

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

Recommended early actions

The following actions are recommended:
•• support the implementation of farmer field schools for training of
smallholder farmers on pest management;
•• since the pest cannot be eradicated in the long term the focus lies on the
development of economically effective pest management techniques for
smallholder farmers;
•• support biological control efforts (development of natural pesticides, e.g
predators and parasitoids);
•• support the country assessment of FAW impact (distribution, mapping,
infestation levels, damage, yield loss, pest population and conducting
case studies);
•• support the design and testing of suitable programmes for pest
management for smallholder farmers in Africa;
•• strengthen regional coordination through monitoring early warning
systems; and
•• support south-south cooperation to share knowledge by facilitating
events.

➤➤ Its larvae feeds mainly on maize and 80 other plant species including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops
and cotton.
➤➤ The first cases were detected in Central and West Africa in early 2016, before spreading across South and East Africa,
where it continues to impact agriculture causing substantial yield losses and reducing the quality of agricultural
outputs.
➤➤ To date, the pest has been recorded in over 40 African countries within a one-year period. In Chad, Equatorial Guinea,
Gabon and the Congo, the pest has been detected and awaiting official reporting.
➤➤ In response to its spread, many farmers increased their use of chemical pesticides. Experts consider the use of such
pesticides as harmful, which can cause environmental damage and present health risks.
➤➤ In particular, women are commonly responsible for applying the pesticides, where the highly hazardous chemicals
can be easily transferred throughout the households. Local human health as well as trade are negatively influenced
due to pesticide residues in food.

➤➤ La Niña is the cooling of the Pacific Ocean temperature, which occurs roughly every three to five years and lasts from
six to 24 months. The intensity of La Niña generally peaks between October and January; however, effects can be felt
afterwards.
➤➤ La Niña 2017/2018 episode is likely to be short-lived and weak, as sea surface temperatures are forecast to warm
again in early 2018.
➤➤ La Niña is not the only factor that affects seasonal weather patterns, and the strength of La Niña does not always
correspond to the strength of its effects on local weather.

Potential impact

➤➤ In the Horn of Africa, the short rains (October–December) and the long rains (March–May) are likely to underperform

with the onset of La Niña and other climate drivers, potentially leading to a fourth and fifth drought-affected seasons.

➤➤ Across Central Asia, reduced precipitation leading to below-average snow accumulation is most likely across west

central Afghanistan and Tajikistan during the 2017-2018 winter growing season. Below-average precipitation across
Afghanistan’s 2017-2018 season could lead to a second consecutive below-average harvest season.
➤➤ Indonesia, the Philippines and the Pacific Islands often experience above-average rainfall during the beginning of
their main rainfall season. Although La Niña is likely to be weak, the most recent rainfall forecasts reflect these
tendencies with above-average rainfall forecast across eastern Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, central
and southern Philippines and many of the western Pacific Islands.
➤➤ According to the global inter-agency El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) analysis cell, comprising of United Nations
operational agencies, World Meteorological Organization, International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent,
civil society and academic partners. The most-at-risk areas to experience La Niña in the first quarter of 2018 are
Afghanistan, southwestern Ethiopia, eastern Kenya, and southern and central Somalia.

At the global level:
•• strengthen the coordination and preparedness capacity of the
international community, through the implementation of the interagency
ENSO Standard Operating Procedures, which will guide collective early
action in relation to ENSO events; and
•• increase joint monitoring and analysis of potential La Niña impacts.
At the regional and national level:
•• increase monitoring of climatic forecasts; and
•• ensure La Niña response, contingency or preparedness plans are updated
or developed to cater for the current context.
In areas likely to be affected by drier than average conditions:
•• review the actual and likely availability of drought-tolerant and early
maturing varieties of crops on the international market for potential
distribution; and
•• foresee the strengthening of the monitoring of animal pests and
diseases and the provision of animal health support to herders.
in areas likely to be affected by wetter than average conditions:
•• review the actual and likely availability of flood-tolerant varieties of
crops;
•• ensure proper shelter, veterinary care and adequate livestock feed in
the most affected areas; and
•• promote the use of saline-tolerant seed varieties, improved agricultural
practices and better water and embankment management.
