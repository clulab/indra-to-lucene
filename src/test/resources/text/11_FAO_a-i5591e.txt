PEACE AND FOOD SECURITY

INTRODUCTION
South Sudan has been mired in
civil conflict since December 2013.
Some 2.8 million people – almost
a quarter of the population - are
now facing acute food and nutrition
insecurity. One of them, Nyalen
Kuong, was on an intravenous
feeding drip. “I’m not sick, I’m
hungry,” she told the camp hospital
doctor. Nyalen lost her husband,
two sons and all the family’s cattle
during an attack on her village.
After the attack, she took shelter
with her daughters and many other
families on islands protected by
miles of swamps. She was suffering
from diarrhoea caused by acute
malnutrition. She ate little food,
and her body was no longer able to
absorb even the meagre nutrients
available. After treatment, Nyalen
returned to her daughters and, with
the help of equipment distributed
by FAO, she is now able to catch
fish in order to survive, and has the
makings of a new livelihood.
Nyalen’s case is but one example
among millions of how conflict
causes hunger, destroys individual
and household resilience, and
undermines rural livelihoods. For
many people affected by conflict,
agriculture is their only means of
survival. Addressing this requires
life-saving interventions, but also
requires support to livelihoods
and resilience, even in abject and
insecure conditions.

Most conflicts mainly affect rural
areas and their populations. This is
particularly true for civil conflicts,
which have tripled in recent years,
and which today are the most
common form of armed conflict,
and increasingly prolonged. Such
conflicts damage agriculture,
disrupt food production and food
systems, fuel the plundering of
crops and livestock, and cause loss
of assets and incomes. As a result,
they are major drivers of food
insecurity and malnutrition, both
acute and chronic.
The proportion of undernourished
people is almost three times
as high in countries in conflict
and protracted crisis than in
other developing countries.
Approximately 167 million
undernourished people live in
countries in protracted crisis today
– roughly one-fifth of all people
suffering from hunger. Malnutrition
tends to affect children the most
and, when it happens at a critical
age may cause life-long mental and
physical handicaps. Conflict has
lasting, multi-generational impacts
on human development.
Food insecurity can trigger
conflict: the sharp increases in
food prices in 2008, accompanied
by cuts in food and fuel subsidies
reduced real incomes of, mainly
urban, populations and triggered

2

food riots in many countries.
Dispossession of assets, such as
land or cattle, or other threats to
food security, can fuel conflict.
Reduced access to food may
compound other forms of grievance
and discontent, such as poverty,
unemployment or marginalisation.
Combining efforts to restore
and support resilient livelihoods
with peacebuilding and conflict
resolution efforts is critical for
sustainable development and
food security and nutrition.
Equally, investing in food
security may strengthen efforts
to prevent conflict and achieve
sustained peace.
For decades, FAO has worked in,
and across, both humanitarian

and development spheres
in order to protect, save and
restore livelihoods, reduce food
insecurity and malnutrition and
improve resilience of livelihoods
and agricultural systems. FAO
supports investments in capacity
at the local, national, regional and
global levels to reduce poverty
and build sustainable food and
agricultural systems.
For example, supporting agriculture
based livelihoods, ensuring
effective coverage of social
protection systems, addressing
issues of land tenure and of access
to natural resources, and fostering
employment opportunities for
youth can effectively contribute to
peacebuilding and post-conflict
recovery. They can also help
people stay on their land when
they feel safe to do so, and create
conducive conditions for the
return of refugees, migrants and
displaced people.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development acknowledges these
challenges, and recognizes peace
as a vital threshold condition
for development, as well as a
development outcome in its own
right. The first two sustainable
development goals focus on
the eradication of poverty and
hunger, and achieving food
security and making agriculture
sustainable. The 2030 Agenda
sees achievement of these goals
as critical to achieving the
further goal of ensuring the
establishment of peaceful and
inclusive societies.
Recognizing that preventing crises
and sustaining peace are shared,
Charter-based responsibilities
across the entire UN system, the
2030 Agenda opens the way to new
and collaborative approaches that
integrate humanitarian assistance
and conflict-prevention through
resilience building efforts.

3

The UN system must work in an
integrated and coherent manner
to provide timely humanitarian
assistance, build resilience to
reduce risk, mitigate and prevent
conflict, and sustain peace. FAO
and its partners have a key role
to play on all of these fronts,
with successful experiences to
build on. Some examples are
presented below, showing how
peace dividends can be derived
from interventions supporting
agriculture and food security.
Reducing armed conflict and
extreme poverty - and addressing
their consequences - are key to
ending hunger. Along with the
eradication of hunger, peace
is essential for achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals.
Food security and agriculture
have a meaningful and often
unnoticed contribution to make to
this global challenge.

The proportion of
undernourished people
living in countries in conflict
and protracted crisis is almost
three times higher than that in
other developing countries.
Post-conflict countries
with high food insecurity
are 40% more likely to relapse
into conflict within a 10-year
timespan.

Agriculture accounts for
two-thirds of employment
and one-third of GDP in
countries in protracted crises.

Civil strife caused a loss
of 438 Kcal in average
per capita daily food-energy
intake in Somalia, about
20% of minimum daily food
requirements.

Livelihoods of 80% of
the population of South
Sudan depend on livestock, a
sector that has lost $2 billion
in potential GDP during the
current conflict.

Since 2000, 48% of civil
conflicts have been in
Africa where access to rural
land underpins the livelihoods
of many and in 27 out of 30
interstate conflicts in Africa, land
issues played a significant role.
Rural Mayan women in
Guatemala exposed to the
country’s civil war (1985-1997)
received 30% less schooling
compared to older and younger
generations.

Every day in 2014, conflicts
and violence forced
approximately 42,500 people to
flee their homes and seek safety
either internally or across borders.
Fewer refugees (only 1%) have
returned, less than at any point
over the past 30 years.

ILLUSTRATIONS
OF FAO’S WORK
It is critical to harness international
assistance to boost resilience, overcoming
the divide between humanitarian and
development investments.
Targeted goals should be food security
and the protection of rural livelihoods.
Investment in agriculture can play
a peace-making role.

SUSTAINABLE
FOOD SECURITY
DURING CONFLICT
Despite ongoing conflict,
agricultural production is
still possible in many parts of
Syria. Even in the midst of the
violence, FAO is operating in
13 of Syria’s 14 governorates,
working to help families stay
on their land when it is safe to
do so, and continue producing
food to feed themselves, their
communities and the country.
With improved seeds from
FAO, farmers are able to make
the most of cultivable areas.
In 2015, despite enormous
challenges and constraints,
Syrian farmers produced
2.4 million tonnes of wheat
– around 60% of the pre-

conflict average. Backyard
production kits are enabling
conflict-affected families to
produce nutritious food close
to their homes with a quick
turnaround, and earn muchneeded income.
Poultry packages have been
particularly important for
women – who often have
little or no income, and are
traditionally responsible for
poultry keeping in Syria.
Moreover, micro-gardens are
helping displaced families to
cultivate vegetables, roots,
tubers and herbs wherever
they are and without the use of
land. Such activities have the
potential to improve household
nutrition, but they also ease
increasing pressures on host
communities, and thus help
reduce tensions, especially
where food supplies and
markets are severely strained.

INFORMATION
FOR EARLY ACTION
Informing stakeholders and
building technical consensus on
the severity of food insecurity is
vital, particularly during conflicts
when access may be compromised.
FAO together with 11 partners
including UN agencies,
international NGOs, donorrelated bodies and regional
intergovernmental bodies working
on food security, promote a
common approach and standards
for food security analysis through

Classification (IPC). IPC is a set of
standardized tools currently used
in over 20 countries to generate
evidence and information on
the severity and causes of food
and nutrition crises as well as
persistent food insecurity.
FAO plays a fundamental role in
raising the flag and in mobilising
global and national responses
when conflicts impact food
security. Only when the IPC team
declared famine (the fifth and
worst level on the IPC scale) in July
2011 did the humanitarian and
development community decide
to intervene at scale in Somalia.
These interventions may have
prevented massive starvation, and
slowly created the conditions for
recovery, but responses came late.
Some months prior to the famine
declaration, FAO and partners
had flagged that the situation
was deteriorating, with many
communities already in IPC Phase
4 (humanitarian emergency).
Many of the 250 000 deaths that
occurred due to famine in Somalia
in late 2010 and 2011 could have
been avoided had the international
community been more responsive
to early warnings from the IPC.
IPC reports are a key tool,
informing decisions by a wide
range of government, UN,
NGO and humanitarian fora.
In Central African Republic and
South Sudan the IPC has helped
to coordinate and prioritise

humanitarian assistance for food
security, helping to mitigate the
humanitarian impact of recent
conflicts (see figure on page 5).

SUPPORTING
REHABILITATION
AND
REINTEGRATION
When families are displaced by
armed conflict, communities
become resource-poor, and
livelihood opportunities and food
sources become very limited.
Disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration (DDR)
programmes aim to support
the voluntary disarmament
and discharge of combatants
from armed groups. FAO
works closely with UN peacebuilding and peace-keeping
actors reintegrating former
combatants in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Mali, and
the Philippines. Since 2005, FAO
has been actively engaged in the
rehabilitation of agriculture- and
fisheries-based livelihoods in
conflict-affected and disasteraffected areas in Mindanao.

return to a life of peace could not
do so, owing to a lack of access
to land and the capital required
to restore their livelihoods.
Facilitating a return to farming
or fishing was therefore key to
the successful reintegration of
former MILF combatants and
displaced households.

Most of the combatants from
the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) in the Philippines
belong to farming and fishing
households and those wanting to

However, replacing lost
productive assets was not
enough. There was also a need
to transition from subsistence

livelihoods. For the transition
period, FAO’s interventions
supported smallholder farmers
and marginal fishers —
including decommissioned MILF
combatants and women, as they
constituted the largest segments
of the workforce — by enhancing
their capacity to jumpstart
their livelihoods, providing an
understanding of how markets
work, facilitating their access to
improved production systems
and making their farms more
climate-resilient.

– but the campaign also
contributed to peace and security.
Conflict has profound
implications for animal
health, and for access to
milk, meat and blood, and
livestock ownership. These
impacts directly affect food
security and nutrition, while
food insecurity can lead to
vicious, multi-decade long
cycles of violent cattle raiding.
Eliminating Rinderpest would
not have been possible without
a conflict-sensitive approach
to animal health, as the last
vestiges of the disease were
harboured in communities
plagued by revenge cycles
of violent livestock raids.
In East Africa, communitybased animal health workers
negotiated peace pacts
between rival pastoral
groups, both in order to gain
access to vulnerable herds
and as a pre-condition for
Rinderpest vaccinations.
This highlights the positive
relationship between support
for food and agriculture and the
management of conflict risks in
the interest of both food security
and peace. Across the Sahel
and elsewhere, FAO vaccination
campaigns offer an important
channel in which to build social
trust, confidence and establish
intercommunity dialogue.

feared to meet with their longstanding enemies, the exchange
visits have been a big success.
Through songs, presentations
and dances, the groups discussed
several issues including livestock
management, breeding, and
conflict resolution.

The cross-border pastoralist
communities of Kenya and
Uganda have been a hotspot for
inter-tribal conflicts for many
years. The conflicts are mainly
linked to cattle raiding among
the Pokot tribe in Kenya and the
Karamojong in Uganda. This has
been compounded by consecutive
years of drought in the region.

Such exchanges have not only
mitigated negative attitudes
between communities, but the
learning and experimentation on
broader community issues has
proved highly critical in building
the communities’ resilience to
conflict and natural disaster
related shocks.

FAO has been strengthening
the capacity of pastoral
communities most vulnerable
to drought through setting up
Pastoralist Field Schools (PFS)
as a way not only to help reduce
and prevent inter-community
conflicts, but also to promote
a learning environment where
community members exchange
information, best practices, and
learn about grassroots ways of
coping with drought risks and
related challenges.
To contribute to wider peacebuilding efforts, FAO conducted
successful PFS exchange visits
between communities on each
side of the border to help mitigate
the frequent livestock raiding.

STRENGTHENING
RESILIENCE AMIDST
CONFLICT
The protracted conflict in Darfur,
Sudan since 2003 has resulted
in massive loss of human life
and assets, disrupted livelihoods
and led to severe food insecurity
in some areas. An estimated
60% out of a total population
of 7-8 million is displaced.
Internally Displaced Persons
and their host communities
have limited livelihood options
and often rely on unsustainable
coping strategies, such as the
unmanaged cutting of trees
and shrubs for fuelwood and
charcoal production. This places
an additional burden on Darfur’s
fragile ecosystem, making
natural resources a potential
conflict trigger.
Fuelwood is the main source
of energy for the vast majority
of people in the Darfur region.

Access to and availability of this
natural resource is increasingly
limited and the effects of
overexploitation already impact
many parts of the region. The
risk of inter-group conflict
over scarce forest and tree
resources is increased. Women
have to venture far – up to 13
kilometres, three times a week
- to collect enough firewood to
cook, exposing themselves to
the risk of physical and sexual

violence. This reduces time
for necessary childcare and
other tasks.
Fuel-efficient stoves reduce fuel
consumption per meal, and cut
smoke emissions from traditional
fires. The materials used to make
the stoves are available locally,
supporting replicability and
cost-efficiency. Local production
and sales of fuel-efficient stoves
become an income-generating
activity for women.
The use of fuel-efficient stoves
confirms that they have numerous
cross-sectoral benefits, including
supporting resilient livelihoods,
improving nutrition and health,
contributing to forest conservation
and environmental protection,
and fighting climate change by
reducing carbon emissions. From
a human security perspective,
this kind of approach decreases
the risks of sexual and genderbased violence women face
when collecting fuelwood, and
helps reduce conflict over scarce
natural resources between host
communities and displaced people.
Promoted by FAO since the 1990s,
improved mud stoves are now
widely used and training continues
to be delivered by partners
and local trainers, providing a
sustainable, multi-faceted solution
in conflict-affected and protracted
crisis situations.

Most conflicts mainly
affect rural areas and their
populations. This is particularly
true for civil conflicts, nowadays
the most common form of armed
conflict.

>

Conflict has strong and
unambiguous adverse effects
on food security and nutrition. It is
the major driver of food insecurity
and malnutrition, both acute and
chronic.

>

Conflict has lasting impacts
on human development as a
result of increased malnutrition,
which tends to affect children the
most and leave lifelong physical
and/or mental handicaps.

Causal effects of the
conflict-food security nexus
vary across conflict zones but
common features are disruption of
food production and food systems,
plundering of crops and livestock
and loss of assets and incomes,
hence directly and indirectly
affecting food access.

Food insecurity can also be
a source of conflict, but not
necessarily so. Where it is, it is
never the one single factor behind
the strife.

include dispossession of assets
(including land and livestock) and
threats to food security (including

FAO data show that, on average,
the proportion of people who
are undernourished is almost
three times as high in countries
in protracted crisis than in other
developing countries (Figure
1). While protracted crises are
typically caused by multiple
factors, conflict is nearly always
one of them. Not all countries
in protracted crisis present very
high levels of undernourishment
because, in some of these
countries, crises are localized to
certain areas or regions. In 2013,
there were approximately 167
million undernourished people
in countries in protracted crisis –
roughly 21 percent of the world’s
undernourished people.

Several aspects of the relationship
between food, hunger, peace and
conflict have been well explored
and documented. First, conflict
tends to have a strong adverse
impact on hunger and food security,
and this finding is uncontested.
Second, there is evidence that
high food prices and lack of
access to food have contributed to
political instability and civil strife.

Other developing
countries

This relationship is nuanced and
needs to be given more careful
consideration. Third, there are
indications that food security
and improved rural livelihoods
may contribute to the mitigation
and prevention of conflicts and
to securing sustainable peace.
However, the nature and strength
of this relationship has been
underexplored.

This note provides a succinct
summary of the main
literature and some evidence
on the hunger-conflict-peace
relationship. What is clear from
the literature is that a deeper
exploration of the relationships
between conflict, food security
and peace would provide a
stronger basis for designing
effective interventions.

PEACE AND FOOD SECURITY

THE IMPACT
OF CONFLICT ON
FOOD SECURITY
Conflict entails enormous and
multifaceted costs, including
direct human suffering and
catastrophic socioeconomic
disruption, which can
significantly impede economic
and social progress. Most
conflicts mainly affect rural
areas and their populations,
with heavy impacts on
agricultural production
and rural livelihoods. This
is particularly true for civil
conflicts, which in recent years
have become the most common
form of armed conflict.1
Conflict can reduce the
amount of food available,
disrupt people’s access to food,
limit families’ access to food
preparation facilities and health
care, and increase uncertainty
about satisfying future needs for
food and nutrition (Simmons,
2013). Poverty rates are 20
percentage points higher in
countries affected by repeated
cycles of violence over the
last three decades. Every
year of violence in a country
is associated with lagging
poverty reduction of nearly
one percentage point (World
Bank, 2011).

Countries with the highest
levels of undernourishment tend
to be those engaged in violent
conflict, or that have recently
emerged from it. High risk of
conflicts is a key characteristic of
fragile states and the probability
of a high burden of hunger
rises exponentially with the
degree of fragility (Figure 2).
The Central African Republic
and Chad are among the worstscoring countries and both have
experienced violent conflict and
political instability in recent
years. In contrast, in Angola,
Ethiopia and Rwanda, hunger
levels have fallen substantially
since their large scale civil wars
of the 1990s and 2000s ended.
Ethiopia was still considered
in protracted crisis in 2010, but
managed to reach the MDG 1c
target of halving the proportion
of the undernourished in its
population, thanks to sustained
political commitment and
efforts to target interventions
to improve food production
and nutrition (FAO, IFAD, and
WFP, 2015). This commitment
probably became possible
as the conflict subsided,
and helped to sustain more
peaceful conditions.

16

Although the causal effects
may differ across conflict zones,
commonly observed features
are that conflicts disrupt food
production through physical
destruction and plundering of
crops and livestock, harvests and
food reserves; they prevent and
discourage farming; they disrupt
food transportation systems;
they destroy farm assets and
capital; they conscript or entice
young men to fight, taking
them away from their work on
the farm; and they suppress
income-earning opportunities
and occupations. Conflict
also makes it difficult for
governments and humanitarian
actors to reach those in need.

economic (2), and political (6). The higher the
index the greater the risk of violence and conflict.
The threshold between situations of “stability” and
“fragility” is 70, right at the point in the graph
where the probability of high prevalence of
undernourishment rises exponentially. Each point in
the graph refers to country estimates for each year

Fragile States Index

The lasting effect of
conflicts is manifest
in its impact on
nutrition, especially
undernutrition during
early childhood with
many of those affected
suffering from lifelong
physical and/or mental
handicaps.

Mortality caused by conflict
through food insecurity and
famine can far exceed deaths
caused directly by violence.
Between 2004 and 2009
approximately 55 000 people a
year lost their lives as a direct
result of conflict or terrorism. 2
In contrast, as a result of famine
caused by drought and conflict,
more than 250 000 died in
Somalia alone between 2010
and 2012. 3
An ‘unheralded achievement’ of
the past 50 years has been the end
of the age of ‘calamitous famines’ –
those that kill more than one million
people – and a significant reduction
in ‘great famines’ – those that kill

17

100 000 people or more (de Waal,
2015). It is posited that this may be
due to the interrelated effects of
factors such as the end of the Cold
War, the adoption of international
human rights norms and the rise
of globalisation. This is not to infer
that famines are over – but today’s
are mostly caused by violent conflict,
exacerbated by natural disasters and
are more often local (Keen, 2008).
Nonetheless, acute and chronic
hunger remains a global problem,
and severe hunger can exist even
without conflict. A number of
South Asian and African countries
face serious or alarming levels
of hunger despite their relatively
stable and peaceful recent history.

PEACE AND FOOD SECURITY

CAN FOOD
INSECURITY LEAD
TO CONFLICT?
As clearly indicated in the
literature, violent conflict is the
major driver of food insecurity
and malnutrition, both acute
and chronic. However, the
causes of armed conflict have
been the subject of lengthy
and controversial debate. The
conclusion of a synthesis of this
literature (World Bank, 2011) is
that there is no simple causal
explanation for conflict. Conflict
comes in many forms, and its
causes are complex, nonlinear,
and mediated by a host of factors.
People resort to violence due to a
broad spectrum of threats to their
human security. This may include
threats to their food security or
- of equal importance - because
they have been dispossessed.
Other factors include loss of
assets and other threats to
their livelihoods, together
with economic and/or political
marginalisation. The precise
contribution of hunger and food
insecurity to conflict is difficult
to assess [Global Hunger Index
(GHI), 2015]. Some of the causes,
such as dispossession and lack of
access to resources, are directly
associated with reduced access
to food.

Greater attention has been given
to the links between food security
and political instability after the
first significant global rise in food
prices in 2008, which coincided with
civil unrest in over 40 countries
(Brinkman and Hendrix, 2011).
The Arab Spring, which toppled
governments in Tunisia, Egypt and
Libya, had a consistent motivating
factor - the price of food. The
protests in Tunisia, which signalled
the start of the Arab Spring domino
effect, were initially demonstrations
against high bread prices. While
public outrage over high food prices
was not the only cause, it is generally
perceived as an important one.
A recent study which explored
whether food prices cause social
unrest (Bellemare, 2015) concluded
that the answer is a qualified ‘yes’.
It argued that although rising food
prices appear to cause food riots, food
price volatility is negatively associated
with or unrelated to social unrest.
While food insecurity may trigger,
fuel or sustain conflicts, the literature
stresses that this is not the only
cause. Sudden and unexpected
food price rises, or the reduction
or removal of subsidies on basic
foodstuffs and cooking fuel can

18

be a catalyst for civil and political
unrest. In other words, they may
become the channel through which
other, wider grievances such as
poverty, unemployment (particularly
of youth), low incomes, unpaid
salaries, political marginalisation
and access to basic services are
expressed (Brinkman and Hendrix,
2011). The corollary is that food price
stabilization measures and safety
nets are critical instruments for
preventing violent conflict.

In fragile states,
a vicious cycle
of instability can
exist whereby food
insecurity both results
from and contributes
to repeated rounds of
armed conflict.
When national governance fails, as
in the case of Somalia, conflict can
lead to large-scale food insecurity
or even famine. But the relationship
can also go the other way. Over
60% of Somalia’s population are
pastoralists and semi-pastoralists
who earn a living from livestock

husbandry. More frequent and
intense droughts often lead to
collapses in livestock prices, and
thus contribute to the conditions
that can cause food insecurity. A
collapse in livestock prices reduces
the incentives for being involved
in “normal” animal husbandry
activities. Therefore, they also
reduce the opportunity cost of
engaging in violent conflicts which
are expected to bring higher income
– and this makes the risks worth
taking (IFPRI, 2014). In this way,
food insecurity can result in more
people entering a conflict and the
vicious cycle continues. In order
to reduce the risk of civil conflict
in this context, it is necessary to
increase the costs of participating in

conflicts for pastoralists and semipastoralists by fostering growth
in the livestock sector, providing
alternative income-earning
opportunities, and establishing
social safety nets (Maystadt and
Ecker, 2014).
Another possible catalyst of wider
inter-group conflict is competition
to control natural resources such
as land and water, required for
food production. However, the
causal relationship between natural
resources, weak governance, conflict
and poor development remains
unclear, and points to the need for
a deeper analysis of the particular
elements and circumstances in
which they are relevant.

19

TECHNICAL NOTE
Finally, there is growing evidence
of a causal relationship between
extreme weather events and the
incidence of civil conflicts. This has
proved to be valid for droughts and
local violent conflicts in Somalia,
and one study estimated that
one standard deviation increase
in the length and intensity of
drought increases the likelihood
of conflict by 62% (Maystadt and
Ecker, 2014). The same study also
found that drought affects conflict
by causing changes in livestock
prices, and suggests that droughtcaused livestock price shocks are a
main driver of local conflict. This
has important implications for
policies and investments in drought
mitigation and resilience building
for both climate change adaptation
and conflict prevention.
However, Brinkman and Hendrix
(2011) highlight contradictory
evidence regarding causality. In
some cases, weather conditions that
reduce agricultural productivity

temperatures - seem to lead to food
insecurity and contribute to civil

may voice their grievances against
inadequate government responses
to their poverty and hunger. In
other cases, good agricultural
weather conditions and high levels
of agricultural productivity provide
both incentives and opportunities
to fuel, and engage in, conflict
incited by other grievances
(Simmons, 2013). In such contexts,
improved agricultural conditions
increase the availability of valuable
assets worth plundering (grains,
land, livestock, etc.).

PEACE AND FOOD SECURITY

FOOD
SECURITY
AND PEACE
DIVIDENDS
It has been argued that, when
implemented appropriately,
well-timed interventions aimed
at improving food security build
resilience to conflict because they
help countries and peoples to cope
with and recover from conflict;
they also contribute to preventing
conflicts, while supporting
economic development more
broadly (IFPRI, 2014). Building
resilience through peacebuilding
efforts has been seen to play a
critical role in supporting food
security outcomes in areas with
recurrent crises (Kurtz and
McMahon, 2015).
However, there is limited
knowledge about the role of
food security in preventing
or mitigating conflicts and,
potentially, in supporting
peacebuilding processes. Based
on a number of disperse findings
in the literature, some potential
mechanisms whereby food
security may affect conflict (or
peace) outcomes are posited.
First, interventions to improve
food security may help weaken
some - but not all - of the welfare-

related motives that may lead
individuals to become fighters or
support armed groups. Second,
greater food price stability and
the recovery of local agricultural
and food markets could help
vulnerable individuals and
households to overcome the
adverse legacies of armed conflict
by encouraging affected people
to move beyond subsistence
agriculture and rejoin exchange
markets. They may also reduce the
appeal of illegal activities. These
effects depend largely on how
the local institutional formation
during wartime affected (either
negatively or positively) the lives
and livelihoods of populations
living in these areas. More work
is required to better understand
these pathways, and acquire more
systematic evidence.
Nonetheless, agriculture is the
dominant form of livelihood for the
majority of households in conflictaffected countries, and efforts to
revive the agricultural sector, foster
economic growth and increase
food security may have positive
effects on the sustainability

20

of peace. In the aftermath of
a social shock, particularly in
fragile settings, it is important
to rapidly re-engage smallholder
farmers - both men and women in productive activities.
Food assistance can offer valuable
peace dividends, as well as
contributing to restoring trust in
governments and rebuilding social
capital (Brinkman and Hendrix,
2011). Findings from a review
of case studies and literature
(Frankenberger, 2012) indicate that
food-based livelihood assistance
has the potential to directly

counterparts. However, there are

to mitigate the risk of conflicts
recurring, and the related impacts
on food security. As noted above,
preventative interventions that
can break the link between
food insecurity and conflict
include mechanisms that shield
consumers and producers from
food price shocks, including food
price stabilization measures and
safety nets.

Broadly speaking, there are a
number of food security related
interventions and measures that

A different perspective, drawing on

agriculture brings new life to

and motivates people to come

research has demonstrated that
it is possible to evaluate psychosocial impacts using, for example,
a Sense of Coherence scale. One
application of this approach to
an FAO programme in the North
Caucasus showed the multiple
contributions of different types
of agriculture programmes
to the recovery process,
including for social regeneration
(Akhilgova, J., et al. 2013).

PEACE AND FOOD SECURITY

ROLE OF WOMEN
IN AGRICULTURE
AND PEACEBUILDING
The role and position of women
is relevant to how conflicts
affect food security and how
food security can support
peacebuilding. In most rural and
agricultural settings, women
are mainly responsible for food
security and nutrition within the
household. In many developing
countries, they also supply the
bulk of agricultural labour,
although they usually find it
harder than men to earn a living
as farmers or agricultural workers
because they often do not have
the same rights as men to own or
control land, buy inputs, obtain
credit, or receive an education (for
example, FAO, 2011; LastarriaCornheil, 2005). During civil strife
and conflict, these constraints
tend to be exacerbated because
more men, who normally assume
a number of responsibilities,
are absent as they engage in
conflict or flee in search of
alternative livelihoods.
Experience and evidence show that
women are more likely to spend
their incomes on food, healthcare
and education. Hence, they are
critical for survival during conflict,
as well as being the drivers in

post-conflict recovery (UN Women,
2012). Targeting women as the first
beneficiaries of food aid and social
protection, as well as helping them
and their communities complete
harvests, can therefore contribute
significantly to improving
household resilience and to
peacebuilding. It is important
to promote women’s economic
empowerment, their right to
access and use resources as well
as their participation in decisionmaking in natural resource
management. Closing the gender
gap in agriculture would generate
significant gains for the agriculture
sector and help build peaceful and
inclusive societies.
The United Nations Security
Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325
(2000) is a landmark framework
that addresses not only the
inordinate impact of conflict on
women, but also the pivotal role
women should, and do, play in
conflict management, conflict
resolution and sustainable peace.
It aims to reinforce women’s
capacities to act as agents in
relief and recovery processes, in
both conflict and post-conflict
situations. Subsequent resolutions

22

have highlighted the role of
women as key actors in economic
recovery, social cohesion and
political legitimacy. Notably, the
UNSCR 2122 (2013) recognizes
“…that the economic empowerment
of women greatly contributes to the
stabilization of societies emerging
from armed conflict”.

This flagship FAO report, on

how each case requires
special attention due to the
way local reponse capacities
erode. Protracted crises are
not a series of one-off shocks
and can derail longer-term
development. They are
lasting threats to both lives
and livelihoods. Building
longer-term assistance
activities on the back of
existing or revitalized local
institutions offers the best hope
of long-term sustainability and
improved food security. Social
protection - school meals, cash
or food-for-work activities - can
make a vital difference in the
long term.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

An analysis of the complex
relationship between ‘peace and
stability’ and the achievement of
development goals (Hong, 2015)
shows that peace and stability are both
the enablers for - and outcome of development.
Reducing armed conflict and
extreme poverty - and addressing
their consequences - are key to
ending hunger. Fostering economic
development and greater equity
within and between countries while
strengthening good governance can
help address the root causes of conflict
(GHI, 2015). Policies and strategies
that reduce development stresses
and mitigate the risks of conflict
simultaneously can be effective in
restoring peace and stability and
create a virtuous cycle between peace
and sustainable development.

With improved data and data
analyses on agricultural and nonagricultural incomes, conflict
models might better predict how
food insecurity related to crop
failure or persistent low productivity
could affect the incentives of rural
households to be involved in
conflicts. Micro-level analyses and
case studies will be crucial to better
understand these relationships.
It is also clear from the literature
that a more in-depth study of the
conflict, food security and peace
nexus would provide a stronger basis
for designing effective interventions.
A more explicit integration of food
security variables into theories of
conflict could help inform external
interventions aimed at mitigating
food insecurity and preventing
conflict.

PEACE
AND
FOOD
SECURITY

Investing in resilience to
sustain rural livelihoods
amid conflict

Peace and food security are mutually reinforcing.
We have often seen hunger recede when stability
prevails, such as in post-conflict Angola and
Nicaragua, post-genocide Rwanda and postindependence Timor-Leste. Similarly, however,
violence and hunger are often locked in vicious cycles
in which one feeds on the other. Conflicts are a key
driver of protracted crises, where the prevalence
of undernourishment is three times higher than
in the rest of the developing world.
FAO plays a fundamental role both in raising the
flag and in mobilising global and national responses

Ironically, most conflicts mainly affect those living
in rural areas, where food is produced. Agriculture
accounts for two-thirds of employment and
one-third of GDP in countries in protracted crises.
As a result, supporting agriculture - helping the most
vulnerable through social protection and building-up
their resilience, addressing issues of land tenure and
access to natural resources, and creating employment
opportunities for youth - can contribute effectively
to peacebuilding.
FAO is working within the new 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development that recognizes that peace
is a vital condition for development by focusing on
eradicating hunger, poverty and malnutrition to
achieve peaceful societies that leave no one behind.

This booklet explains the relationship between peace,
conflict and food security and FAO’s experience on
the ground that shows how investing in food security
helps fight hunger and builds peace.

when conflicts impact food security, for example in
2011 in Somalia, and in Syria where FAO is working
with partners to strengthen the food security and
resilience of those that remain on their land, most
of whom are women and children. FAO also works
closely with UN peace-building efforts to reintegrate
former combatants in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Mali and the Philippines.

FAO has long been concerned about the impact of
war on food security and on how hunger can be one
of the drivers of instability and conflict but we also
know that actions to promote food security can help
prevent a crisis, mitigate its impacts and promote
post-crisis recovery and healing.
