South Sudan: Floods - Sep 2017
Glide: FL-2017-000137-SSD
Overview
According to the State Ministry of Health, it is estimated that over 11, 000 people have been aﬀected by ﬂooding caused by heavy rainfall in 11 payams
of Aweil North and Aweil West of former Northern Bahr el Ghazal State. More ﬂooding also caused some deaths and injuries and has deeply aﬀected
the daily lives of over 650 households in eight villages of Bunj payam, Maban County, Upper Nile State. (WHO, 18 Sep 2017)
Heavy rains and ﬂoods have aﬀected several parts of South Sudan, including Aweil North, Aweil East, Raja, and Maban counties; and parts of Eastern
and western Equatoria. Thousands of people have been displaced while several roads have been washed away, making transport diﬃcult. In addition,
farmlands have been destroyed, which is likely to impact on the expected harvest, worsening the food security situation next year. (WHO, 28 Sep 2017)
In September, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Jonglei states experienced ﬂooding as a result of heavy rains. UNICEF together with partners responded to
over 20,000 households aﬀected by the ﬂooding in Northern Bahr el Ghazal with provision of supplies, including household water treatment products
and water containers. However, the WASH sector continues to face a signiﬁcant funding gap (54 per cent). (UNICEF, 30 Sep 2017)
Torrential rain has caused major damage across the region with the combination of a stream bursting its banks and the overﬂow from the Kengen,
Lothila and Kubal rivers causing massive ﬂoods across Pibor. More than 2000 households are now in need of urgent assistance. The situation remains
particularly volatile for eight counties located along the river. Latilak, Babuzen, Vertek, Likuangole, Pochalla, Ajwara, Pibor North and South Counties
have seen their farms wiped out and children are unable to get to school...If water continues to rise, access to the area via the Pibor airstrip could be
aﬀected. The state legislative assembly has been damaged and many government oﬃcials have been cut oﬀ from their oﬃces. The acting Governor of
Boma, Omot Ogul Abai, is appealing for urgent assistance. (UNMISS, 13 Oct 2017)
