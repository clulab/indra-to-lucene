humanitarian needs & key figures

humanitarian

needs & key figures
The world’s newest nation, South Sudan, is faced with myriad challenges, some
of which arise from historical marginalization, conflict and under-development
whilst others are driven by more recent developments, including the armed
conflict since December 2013. There are humanitarian needs across South
Sudan as a result of multiple and interlocking threats: armed conflict and
inter-communal violence, economic decline, disease, and climactic shocks.

Humanitarian needs

1

The population
is uprooted. More
than 2.3 million
people one in every
five people in South
Sudan - have been forced to flee
their homes since the conflict
began, including 1.66 million
internally displaced people
(with 50 per cent estimated to
be children1) and nearly 646,000
refugees in neighbouring
countries.

2

Hunger is
widespread. 3.9
million people –
nearly one in every
three people in South
Sudan – were severely food
insecure and 3.6 million were
considered to be ‘stressed’, in
September 2015. An estimated
30,000 people were facing
catastrophic food insecurity (IPC
Level 5), leading to starvation,
death, and destitution during the
same period.

3

Another
generation is
at risk. Nearly
one in every three
schools in South
Sudan has been destroyed,
damaged, occupied or closed,
impacting on the education of
more than 900,000 children,
including some 350,000 who
have been forced out of school
by the conflict. More than
686,200 children under age
5 are estimated to be acutely
malnourished, including more
than 231,300 who are severely
malnourished. Between 15,000
to 16,000 children are estimated
to be recruited by armed forces
in South Sudan. Over 10,000
children have been registered as
unaccompanied, separated or
missing. An adolescent girl in
South Sudan is three times more
likely to die in childbirth than
complete primary school.

4

Thousands have
lost their lives.
Mortality has been
exacerbated by
acute malnutrition
and disease, with more than
one in five Counties surveyed
(10 out of 46) having Crude
Death Rates (CDR) above the
threshold of 1 death per 10,000
people per day. There continues
to be deaths from preventable
diseases. Malaria is the biggest
recorded killer, with more than
1,100 deaths due to the disease
reported in health facilities from
January to October 2015.

5

Infrastructure
losses are
extensive. 110
million square
metres of land is
known to be contaminated
by landmines and explosive
remnants of war. Thousands of
homes have been ruined during
the fighting. In three counties
of Unity State alone, more than
9,000 structures are estimated
to have been destroyed or
damaged from April to October
2015. As if September 2015,
some 55 per cent of the health
facilities in Greater Upper NIle
were no longer functioning.

6

Sexual and
gender-based
violence is
pervasive. In Leer,
Mayendit and Koch
counties of Unity State from
April to September 2015, an
estimated 1,300 women and
girls were raped and 1,600
women and children abducted.

Impacts of Multiple crises

Impacts of

Multiple crises
Across South Sudan, people have been affected by multiple and interlocking
threats, including armed conflict, inter-communal violence, economic decline,
disease and climactic shocks.
Despite the signing of the Agreement on the Resolution
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan in August
2015, violence continues to affect civilians in Unity, Upper
Nile, Jonglei, Lakes, Western Equatoria and Central
Equatoria. Civilians have been attacked and homes have
been destroyed. It is estimated that Koch, Leer and Mayendit
counties in Unity State saw 95 incidents of insecurity and
fighting between May and September 2015, affecting at least
29 villages and towns. The conflict has littered vast swathes of
land, access routes and buildings with unexploded ordnance
that threatens the safety of individuals, communities
and humanitarian actors. The International Crisis Group
estimated that between 50,000 to 100,000 people across
South Sudan had been killed in the period December 2013
to November 20143. This number increased as fighting
continued 2015. In Leer, Mayendit and Koch counties of
Unity State, an estimated 1,080 civilians were killed from
April to October 2015.
In addition to the conflict, communities are struggling with
inter-communal violence, including as a result of cattle
raiding. In Lakes State, for example, at least 470 people were
killed and some 300 people were injured in the first nine

months of 2015. In the second half of 2015, fighting between
armed actors erupted in new locations, including in Western
and Central Equatoria. The conflict in Greater Upper Nile has
disrupted livestock migration patterns, contributing to new
patterns of natural resource-based conflicts between cattle
keepers and settled farming populations, including in the
Equatorias and Warrap State. It has restricted communities’
movement and access to markets and services, and has eroded
positive coping strategies.
Violations against civilians have been widely reported.
Sexual and gender-based violence has been used as reward
for fighters and one in four cases of gender-based violence
reported to humanitarian partners involve sexual violence.
In Leer, Mayendit and Koch counties of Unity from April to
September 2015, an estimated 1,300 women and girls were
raped and 1,600 women and children abducted. Even in close
proximity to the Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites, women
have been killed or attacked when collecting firewood.
Between 15,000 to 16,000 children, primarily boys, have been
recruited and are being used by armed actors.

More than one in five people in South Sudan have
been forced to flee their homes in the past 22 months,
including over 1.66 million people who are currently
internally displaced and nearly 646,000 people who have
fled to neighbouring countries as refugees. Many have
been displaced multiple times because of repeated attacks,
particularly in counties such as Leer, Koch, Mayendit and
Rubkona in Unity State, Fangak and Pigi County in Jonglei,
and Malakal and surrounding areas in Upper Nile. Some
185,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) have sought
refuge in UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites4, while
around 90 per cent of IDPs are on the run or sheltering
outside PoC sites. Due to the fluidity of displacement, it is
difficult to determine the number of IDP returnees. However,
humanitarian partners estimate that some 300,000 will be
in need of assistance in 2016. Children, the elderly, people
with disabilities and people living with HIV have been
particularly vulnerable during displacement; the majority of
the displaced are children. Many families report having had to
abandon the aged and infirm when they fled attacks through
difficult and swampy terrain. Children have drowned as they
attempted to flee. Over 10,000 separated, unaccompanied,
and missing children have been identified by humanitarian
partners. Thousands of people living with HIV have seen
their life-sustaining treatment interrupted without possibility
of resumption and fresh violence in Western and Central
Equatoria is affecting populations with the highest prevalence
rates of HIV/AIDS in South Sudan.
Insecurity and traumatic incidents have affected millions of
civilians. An estimated one million children are believed to be

in psychosocial distress and a survey in South Sudan in July
2015 found that 41 per cent of respondents showed symptoms
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)5. Respondents
experienced a mean of 7.62 traumatic experiences during
their lifetimes, with the most frequent traumatic experiences
being the killing of a close family member (63 per cent) and
the destruction of a house (55 per cent) or other property
(64 per cent). Due to decades of conflict, nearly eight
million people in South Sudan live in counties where there
are unexploded ordnance or explosive remnants of war. In
recently conducted surveys in Juba PoC1, Juba PoC3 and
Mingkaman, 92 per cent, 84 per cent and 82 per cent of IDPs
respectively indicated that lack of security remains their main
reason for not returning, while lack of food was cited most
frequently as the second reason (by 60 per cent, 33 per cent
and 39 per cent of respondents respectively).
Due to instability in neighbouring countries, the refugee
population in South Sudan has increased. South Sudan
is hosting 265,770 refugees from Sudan, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia and the Central
African Republic (CAR). This number is expected to increase
to 304,072 by the end of 2016. Due to fighting in Sudan’s
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, refugees continue to
arrive in Pariang, Unity State and Maban, Upper Nile State.
The capacity of Ajuong Thok camp in Unity state is reaching
its limit and the establishment of a new camp is crucial. All
refugees are in need of international protection. These needs
are more acute among women, children and youth who face
greater protection risks, including sexual and gender-based
violence, child marriage and forced recruitment by armed

actors. With nearly 90 per cent of refugees living in camps in
Upper Nile and Unity States where the South Sudan conflict
has been particularly intense, tensions over scarce resources
have increased between refugees and local populations.

“Re-build old clinics and hospitals
destroyed by the war”
“Re-build water pipes”
“Re-build the schools that have been
destroyed during the war”
-Quotes from people in Malakal regarding their
needs if they were to return home.
Vital civilian infrastructure, including health and
education facilities, water points, markets, roads and
airstrips, has been damaged, destroyed and shut down
due to direct attacks, generalized insecurity, economic
crises, and lack of resources and staff. Prior to the conflict,
healthcare was extremely difficult to access in South Sudan,
with an estimated 0.15 doctors per 10,000 patients and
0.2 midwives/nurses per 10,000 people. This has been
exacerbated by the fighting, with some 55 per cent of health
facilities in the Greater Upper Nile region not functioning
as at September 2015. Education infrastructure also has
been dramatically impacted by violence. Nearly one in three

schools (1,066 out of 3,125) in South Sudan is now closed,
impacting the education of more than 900,000 children,
including some 350,000 who have been forced out of school
by the conflict. Since December 2013, 331 schools have been
damaged or destroyed and 113 have been or remain occupied
by armed actors. 53 schools are being used as shelters by
IDPs. When fighters abandon schools they have occupied or
damaged, they often leave behind small arms ammunition
and UXOs that render the buildings unsafe. An adolescent girl
in South Sudan is three times more likely to die in childbirth
than complete primary school.
South Sudan’s economic crisis has been driven by the
rapidly depreciating value of the South Sudanese Pound
(SSP), shortages of hard currency, global declines in oil
prices and significant dependence on imports. The South
Sudan annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by
91.3 per cent from September 2014 to September 2015, with
a 14.9 per cent increase from August 2015 to September
20156. The informal exchange rate of SSP against the US
dollar reached an all-time low of 18 SSP to US$1 in October
2015 – compared to an official rate of 2.9 SSP to $1. The
price of staple foods, such as sorghum, maize and beans, are
at record highs (up to 150 per cent compared to average),
affecting the purchasing power of households across the
country, particularly in the Greater Bahr el-Ghazal states
and amongst the urban poor. From mid-2014 to mid-20157,
oil production accounted for 99 per cent of exports, 95 per
cent of government revenue and about 50 per cent of GDP
in South Sudan. Whilst crippling the Government’s social

services sector, the decline in oil price has negatively affected
more than 40 percent of the population, both poor and
non-poor. Since December 2013, an additional one million
people have been pushed below the poverty line8. Reports
indicate that people are increasingly resorting to negative
coping mechanisms, including child labour and child
marriage. Intimate partner violence, which often rises during
conflict and economic decline, accounts for 50 per cent of the
incidents of gender-based violence reported to humanitarian
partners. As at September, 30 per cent of the urban poor were
in IPC Phase 3 or 4.

“Before we were displaced, family
members used to farm and fish but
now we don’t have any tools. I sell
canes at the market to be able to
buy some food”
– a woman in Wau Shilluk explained to OCHA.

06

Conflict, insecurity, market disruption, economic
downturn and localized crop failures have caused record
high food prices and hunger has spread to locations that
were previously stable. Livelihoods have been decimated
by the conflict and economic decline, with livestock looted,
killed and disease-prone and crops destroyed or planting
delayed due to violence and displacement. In September
2015, there were an estimated 3.9 million South Sudanese
people were severely food insecure and 3.6 million were
considered to be ‘stressed’, The situation is most alarming in
parts of Unity State, where 30,000 people were estimated to
be facing extreme lack of food and other basic needs, leading
to starvation, death and destitution (IPC Level 5). Some
households have had to reduce their food intake to as little
as one meal per day, consisting of only fish and water lilies.

These seasonal resources will become even scarcer over the
dry season. Women and the elderly have been particularly
impacted by the increasing food shortage, as households
are prioritizing food for children. Women are shouldering
the burden of foraging for wild foods that are increasingly
depleted, forcing them to travel longer and arduous distances
by foot, and exposing them to the risk of attacks or sexual
violence. The loss of protein sources more rapidly affects
women, who are more vulnerable to Vitamin A deficiency.
In addition to the deterioration of the situation for the most
vulnerable, food insecurity has spread to areas previously
considered relatively food secure, including Northern Bahrel-Ghazal, Lakes, Warrap and the Greater Equatoria (Central,
Eastern and Western Equatoria), highlighting the deepening
cumulative impact of conflict, economic downturn and
climactic shocks. Households considered stressed (IPC Level
2) are able to minimally meet their food needs but are unable
to meet their basic non-food needs without resorting to
negative coping mechanisms.

“No one has their cattle anymore and
people want to have them back to be
able to get milk and meat and become
less dependent on humanitarian
organizations”
– a person in Bor speaking of their greatest needs
in listening group convened for the HNO.
The rising cost of living and impact of the conflict have
also undermined people’s ability to access safe water. It is
estimated that only 13 per cent of South Sudanese people
have access to improved sanitation, while 85 per cent of the
population practice open defecation and only 41 per cent have
access to safe water. Families in urban centres have had to

spend an increasing portion of their income to obtain clean
water, while water trucking has decreased due to the cost of
fuel9. Borehole repairs have not been possible in areas hardest
hit by conflict, including large swathes of Upper Nile, due to
lack of access due to insecurity and lack of technical expertise
and supplies. Lack of access to safe water and sanitation poses
protection risks for women, with the search to find a safe
place to defecate and the trek to collect water leaving women
exposed to the threat of violence. When consulted about
their needs, focus groups convened for the HNO highlighted
shortage of water as a growing source of tension. More than
500,000 IDPs live in flood-prone areas, where the spread of
water-borne diseases, including cholera, remains a major
concern. For the second year in a row, the Government
declared a cholera epidemic in 2015 with more than 1,800
cholera cases, including 47 deaths, reported in Juba County
and in Bor, Jonglei State.

“There’s a shortage of water in villages
so people are fetching water from the
Nile River”
– a person in Mingkaman speaking about
their most urgent needs in a focus group
for the HNO.
Diseases endemic to South Sudan continue to cause death
and illness. From January to October 2015, more than 2.1
million cases of malaria were reported in health facilities,
including more than 1,100 deaths. These figures include only
deaths reported at health facilities and the overall death rate
from disease is likely much higher, as the national disease
surveillance system is functioning at barely 50 per cent of
expected levels. There have been five confirmed outbreaks of
measles in 2015, in Bentiu PoC (Unity State), Duk (Jongei),
Wulu (Lakes), and Yei and Juba PoC 3 (Central Equatoria).
Conflict, displacement and lack of access have frustrated

efforts to ensure vaccination coverage with the disruption
of routine immunization: only six out of South Sudan’s 79
counties have the requisite minimum 80 per cent measles
vaccination coverage and 55 counties have less than 60
per cent coverage, including 26 with less than 20 per cent
coverage, mostly in the Greater Upper Nile. This has resulted
in two cases of circulating vaccine derived Poliovirus type 2
(cVDPV) reported in Mayom County, Unity state in 2015.
An estimated 400,000 children under age 5 remain at risk
of contracting measles in Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei.
Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) outbreaks were a major public health
challenge in IDP populations in 2015. Stock-outs of essential
medicines are likely to exacerbate the already dire health
situation, as health facilities are likely not to have access to
lifesaving essential medicines into early 2016.
Malnutrition has spiked as a result of lack of access to safe
water and sanitation, increasing disease rates, rising food
insecurity and conflict. More than 1 million people across
South Sudan are now acutely malnourished. This includes an
estimated more than 231,300 children under age 5 who are
severely acutely malnourished (SAM), more than 454,900
children who are moderately acutely malnourished (MAM),
some 316,200 pregnant and lactating women and 3,900
elderly IDPs in PoCs. The resumption of conflict in April 2015
led to the closure of 80 outpatient therapeutic programme
and 91 therapeutic supplementary feeding programme sites in
Unity and Upper Nile States between April and June, cutting
off access to treatment for more than 5,600 SAM and nearly
out of
of 50 counties surveyed in 2015,
17,500 MAM children. Out

(GAM) rates deemed to
be critical (above 15 per cent), including two counties in
Unity where GAM rates were more than twice the emergency
threshold. Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition
are nine times more likely to die than their healthy peers,
while those with moderate acute malnutrition are three times
more likely to die.

As the crisis prolongs, affected people need better
information regarding the situation and the humanitarian
response. With just one per cent of the population having
access to the internet and only around one in five people
having access to a mobile phone, radio and “word of mouth”
remain the most common methods of communication
in South Sudan. In recent surveys, only around one
third of people who participated felt that they had all of
the information that they needed. The top priorities for
displaced people in PoC sites include the need for impartial
information regarding the peace process, the situation in
their areas of origin, services available to people returning
to pre-displacement areas, services available in their place of
displacement (including how to access food, education and
healthcare), how to find people with whom they have lost
contact and the general situation outside of the PoC sites and
across the country.

Overview

No. of people in need

1.66 million people remain on the move in South
Sudan, and displacement will continue to be a
significant factor in 2016. Of these, an estimated
604,000 are in need of direct Camp Coordination
and Camp Management (CCCM) services, including IDPs
in camp and camp-like settings and a preliminary estimate
of 300,000 returnees. In addition, displacement tracking is
needed for all 1.66 million IDPs. The most acute needs remain
in Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei, but inter-communal fighting
in Lakes and Western Equatoria is also driving displacement.
Despite the signing of the peace agreement, fighting has yet to
cease and shifting front lines continue to cause people to flee
multiple times. In addition, a projected 304,000 refugees are
in need of camp coordination and camp management services

Greater Upper Nile, particularly due to growing tensions
and clashes in Central and Western Equatoria. Over one
million displaced people live outside the PoC sites. The
already limited resources of host communities have been
further depleted, and in many instances exhausted, due to
accommodating IDPs. In 2015, the number of people seeking
protection inside Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites almost
doubled. The living conditions inside PoCs have improved
through the expansion and upgrade of the sites. However, the
constant influx of new arrivals has meant that over 100,000
people across all sites have been forced to share a shelter with
another family.

Overview

No. of people in need

The education of 967,000 children has been
affected by conflict and displacement, the
majority of them in Unity, Jonglei, Upper Nile and
Lakes states. Nearly one in three schools across
the country are not functional (1,066 out of 3,125), including
331 that have been damaged or destroyed. The Primary Net
Enrolment rate in South Sudan decreased from 42 per cent
in 2013 to 35 per cent in 2015,10 as a result of disruption of
education services due to conflict and displacement, as well
as lack of facilities, trained teachers, supplies and funding. In
addition, some 121,000 refugee children in South Sudan are
in need of education assistance.

South Sudanese school-aged children (3 to 18 years old) have
been endangered and had their education disrupted by attacks
against schools (113 incidents of military use and attacks on
schools, affecting more than 36,700 children11). Though all
children who have been displaced are vulnerable, adolescent
boys and young men remain particularly vulnerable to
participation in dangerous activities and recruitment by
armed actors. Adolescent girls are at risk of early and forced
marriage, as well as sexual abuse and exploitation due to the
low value placed on the girl child. The closure of learning
spaces has left separated and unaccompanied minors without
opportunities for case management.

Humanitarian needs and drivers
Some 967,000 children have lost access to education due to
the crisis in South Sudan.12 School-aged children represent
more than 47.75 per cent of the displaced population.13
Fighting and displacement have been the main drivers leading
to interruption of education and lack of protection for 3-18

This interruption of education will have immediate,
medium and long-term consequences for the stability and
development of the country as children who are not in school
will lack the structure and stimulation for healthy cognitive
and psychosocial development that a child’s developing mind
requires. The risk is high that more out-of-school adolescents
voluntarily join or are forcibly recruited by armed actors.14
Children, parents and the community consider education a
critical priority.

continued, the quality of teaching deteriorated due to missed
opportunities to train teachers, delays or cessations in salary

Affected people
The displaced are most in need of emergency shelter and
non-food items, particularly in Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei
states. In both Unity and Upper Nile, many people have
been displaced multiple times. Of the displaced, women and
children are especially vulnerable both due to their roles in
society and the protection risks inherent in being without
shelter or social support networks. A small number of host
community members, who have used their already limited
resources to provide for the displaced, also require assistance.

Humanitarian needs and drivers
Forced displacement remains a defining feature of the crisis
in South Sudan, with more than 1.66 million people currently
internally displaced. New outbreaks of violence continue to
push more people to flee their homes, leaving their shelter and
belongings behind. Many people have been displaced multiple
times, particularly in Counties such as Leer, Koch, Mayendit
and Rubkona in Unity State, Fangak and Canal/Pigi Counties

In southern Unity State alone, more than 9,000 structures
were estimated to have been destroyed or damaged as at
October 2015. Ongoing perceptions of insecurity continue
to prevent people from moving out of the PoC sites and may
cause additional influxes, particularly in Malakal and Bentiu.
The deteriorating economic situation and the accompanying
lack of markets and cash has decreased the ability of both
IDPs and host communities to cope with the ongoing crisis,
making them further dependent on humanitarian assistance.

food security and livelihoods
Overview

No. of people in need

There were 3.9 million South Sudanese people
(34 per cent of the population) experiencing
severe food insecurity and 3.6 million who
were considered to be ‘stressed’, in September
2015. This is an 80 per cent increase compared to the same
period last year. The situation is most alarming in parts of
Unity State, where 30,000 people were estimated to be facing
extreme lack of food and other basic needs. The Integrated
Phase Classification (IPC) analysis indicates that, if the
conflict continues, food availability and access will deteriorate
heightening the risk of famine from October to December
2015, particularly in Unity State. In addition, some 304,000
refugees in South Sudan are expected to need food assistance
in 2016.

Equatoria . For the first time in the IPC history of South Sudan,
large deterioration can be seen in the Greater Equatoria region
due to market disruption, economic downturn, insecurity and
localized crop failures. The economic downturn has resulted
in record high food prices (up to 150 per cent compared to
average), which has significantly affected the purchasing power
of households, particularly in Greater Bahr el Ghazal and
amongst the urban-poor.
Conflict continues to have a profound impact on livelihoods.
Multiple shocks, such as loss of livestock due to looting
and disease, crop failure and multiple displacement, have
left people with no choice but to rely on wild food and/or
humanitarian assistance.

Displaced households and people trapped in conflict

consumption gaps, with some households reducing intake
to as little as one meal per day consisting of only fish and
water lilies. However, food insecurity is spreading and
deepening. Women and the elderly have been particularly
impacted by increasing food insecurity, as meals are often
given first to children and women bear the burden of foraging
for increasingly scarce wild foods in arduous terrain and
dangerous conditions.

are likely to exacerbate the already critical situation.

The conflict has compounded an already dire health situation
and caused a major public health crisis disrupting essential
primary and secondary health care services. Prior to the
current crisis, South Sudan had shocking health indicators,
including the maternal mortality rate (2,054/100,000 livebirths), neonatal mortality rate (43/1,000), infant mortality
rate (83/1,000) and under-five mortality rate (106/1,000).
Health facilities have been attacked, damaged and looted. As
of September 2015, some 55 per cent of the health facilities
in Unity State, Upper Nile State and Jonglei were no longer
functioning. In Unity, more than 1 million people access one
single county hospital. Vaccination, malnutrition screening and
antenatal care have been interrupted, while surgery and referral
services are limited or non-existent, as are services to manage
HIV, TB and mental health. Stock-outs of essential medicines

Communicable diseases are a concern throughout the country
due to poor sanitation, lack of access to safe water and
crowded living conditions. There has been a notable upsurge
in the scale and frequency of outbreaks of epidemic prone
diseases, especially in displacement sites where malnutrition
and poor immunity renders young children and pregnant
women particularly vulnerable. Conflict, displacement and
lack of access have frustrated efforts to ensure vaccination
coverage: only six out of South Sudan’s 79 counties having the
requisite minimum 80 per cent measles vaccination coverage
and 26 counties with less than 20 per cent coverage, mostly in
the Greater Upper Nile. An estimated 400,000 children under
age 5 remain at risk of contracting the disease.

The nutrition situation remains precarious,
with more than 1 million people acutely
malnourished. Nearly 686,300 children under
age 5 are acutely malnourished, including more
than 231,300 severely malnourished children and more
than 454,900 moderately malnourished children. More than
312,200 malnourished pregnant and lactating women require
assistance countrywide, and 3,900 elderly IDPs in PoCs are
estimated to be moderately malnourished. In addition, some
304,000 refugees are expected to need nutritional assistance
in 2016.

The overall nutrition situation remains Critical, with GAM
prevalence above the Emergency threshold (GAM >15%)
in Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile States. Out of 50 counties
surveyed in 2015, 33 had GAM rates deemed to be critical
(above 15 per cent), including two counties in Unity
(Mayom and Rubkona, which hosts Bentiu PoC) where
GAM rates were above the Catastrophe threshold (>30%).
It is anticipated that the situation in the counties of origin
of people arriving in Bentiu PoC is worse. The continued
increase in malnutrition has been driven by rising food
insecurity, increasing spread of endemic diseases (Malaria,

The resumption of conflict in April 2015 led to the closure
of 80 outpatient therapeutic programme and 91 therapeutic
supplementary feeding programme sites between April and
June, cutting access to treatment for 5,624 SAM and 17,455

condition that requires urgent treatment. Children suffering
from severe acute malnutrition are nine times more likely
to die than their healthy peers, while those with moderate
acute malnutrition are three times more likely to die.
Undernourished children who survive may become locked in a
cycle of recurring illness and faltering growth, with irreversible
damage to their development and cognitive abilities.

Humanitarian needs and drivers
Targeting of civilians continued throughout 2015 in multiple
locations in South Sudan. Ethnically-targeted attacks, sexual
violence and other gender-based violence, grave violations
of children’s rights (notably child recruitment), abduction,
family separation, and threats from mines and explosive
remnants of war (ERW) all continued to be prevalent and
to threaten the lives and livelihoods of civilians. By the
second quarter of 2015, there were twice as many reports
of children being killed, and almost three times as many
reports of sexual assault against children, compared with
the entire year of 2014. Around one million children are
likely to be suffering from psycho-social distress. Rape and

IDPs outside PoC sites and in areas that have remained largely
inaccessible due to the conflict have the highest WASH needs.
These include about 750,000 people that were cut off from
access to safe drinking water and food in southern Unity
and Upper Nile for more than five months in 2015, as well
as people in areas where conflict has erupted more recently,
including in the Greater Equatoria. People in PoCs require
ongoing WASH assistance to prevent further outbreaks of
water-borne and water-related disease, including cholera.

The protracted conflict in South Sudan has compounded
the WASH needs of an already vulnerable population. It is
estimated that only 13 per cent of South Sudanese people
have access to improved sanitation, while 85 per cent of the
population practice open defecation and only 41 per cent
have access to safe water. The main drivers of vulnerabilities
related to WASH are closely linked to the conflict. In Unity,
Upper Nile and Jonglei, the existing WASH services outside
PoC sites are inadequate to address the needs of both the
displaced and host communities and have been further

overstretched by new arrivals. WASH infrastructure has been
deliberately targeted by armed actors. Other main drivers
include natural disasters and lack of services due to chronic
under-development that increase pressure on scarce supplies.
The lack of WASH investment in urban areas has resulted in
a worsening public health crisis leading to yearly occurrences
of cholera outbreaks. Over the past year, this trend has been
exacerbated by a dramatic rise in the cost of safe water for
urban residents. High malnutrition rates are also strongly
linked to poor WASH conditions, as exemplified in the
diarrhea-malnutrition cycle which is prevalent in vulnerable
populations.

information and INFRASTRUCTURE

information and INFRASTRUCTURE
Overview
South Sudan is one of the most logistically challenging
places in the world and has one of the most underdeveloped
communications technology infrastructures. The severely
under developed and under maintained roads makes 60 per
cent of the country inaccessible by road during the rainy
season. In a country of approximately 650,000 km2, there
is only one sealed international road, the 192 km stretch
between Juba-Nimule on the Ugandan border. The majority

of river ports are in poor condition, resulting in significant
delays with loading and offloading. Since the eruption
of the conflict, telecommunications infrastructure has
been vandalized and destroyed. The absence of a national
communications backbone, the unreliability of the minimal
mobile network and the lack of access to conventional
power sources creates a challenging starting point for
communicating with communities.

In order to better reflect the voices of affected people in the
HNO, InterNews held 34 listening groups in Bor PoC, Juba

during these sessions are reflected throughout the document.

Given the absence of reliable baseline data, determining
the overall number of people in need in South Sudan is
challenging. For the purpose of the HNO, a calculation was
used which the number of People in Need was calculated by:
a) breaking down the number of people in need per cluster at
county-level; b) identifying the highest cluster people in need
figure per county; and c) adding up the highest cluster people
in need figures per county to develop the total. This method
of calculation minimizes the risk of duplication as it calculates
the number of unique individuals in need, rather than doublecounting across clusters.

SUDAN

!

For this Humanitarian Needs Overview, partners utilised
existing population projections, alongside available information
regarding displacement, including the counties of origin of
people who have fled the country as refugees and those who
have arrived at PoC sites, in order to attempt to determine
the number of people in need across the country. It is
recognised that there is a wide margin of possible error in these
calculations. However, they are the best available at this time.

Humanitarian assessments conducted in 2015

! ! ! !

The challenge of providing concrete data in South Sudan
is well known. The last census of the area was conducted in
2008 and all population data since that time has been based
on projections. The National Bureau of Statistics projected
that by mid-2015 the population of South Sudan would be
11.6 million. While these projections may have been partially
reliable prior to the conflict, the degree of displacement
during the conflict has made it immensely difficult to track
the movement of people. At the same time, due to insecurity
and logistical constraints, many of the remote locations
in which IDPs are sheltering have not been accessible and
displacement figures are therefore also rough estimates. The
combination of these factors makes it challenging to estimate
the number of IDPs and the host community population
in any given location. Another challenge generated by the
absence of accurate baseline data is the scarcity of sex and age
disaggregated data.

there continue to be substantial gaps in the humanitarian
community’s knowledge regarding the needs across the
country. In the coming six months, humanitarian partners
have committed to working, together with relevant
authorities, to further refine population and displacement
estimates in order to better determine the location and
number of people in need. Humanitarian partners will focus
in particular on filling information gaps in areas that have
been inaccessible. Humanitarian partners will also focus on
improving availability of sex and age disaggregated data.
