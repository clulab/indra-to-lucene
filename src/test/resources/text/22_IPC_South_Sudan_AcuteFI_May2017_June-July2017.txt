INTEGRATED FOOD SECURITY PHASE CLASSIFICATION
THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN
Current Period Classified: May 2017
Projection Period for Most Likely Scenarios: June-July 2017

MAY 2017 – COMMUNICATION SUMMARY


Food security in South Sudan has further deteriorated due to armed conflict, economic crisis, and below1
average harvests that were exhausted well before the ongoing lean season. An estimated 6.0 million (50% of
the population) people are expected to be severely food insecure in June-July 2017, compared to 5.5 million (45%
of the population) people in May 2017. This is the greatest number of people ever to experience severe food
insecurity (IPC Phases 3, 4 and 5) in South Sudan



Famine is no longer occurring in Leer and Mayendit counties, and further deterioration was prevented in Koch
and Panyijiar counties of former Southern Unity State as a result of immediate and sustained multi-sector
humanitarian assistance delivered to the affected population since March 2017. The early detection of the
deterioration of the food security situation into famine followed by the subsequent large-scale immediate
response averted further loss of life, thus underscoring the importance of evidence based analysis and
response. However, in June-July 2017, approximately 45,000 people will still be facing Humanitarian
Catastrophe in Leer, Koch, Mayendit in former Unity State and Ayod County in former Jonglei state based on
most likely assumptions of continued armed conflict, food shortages associated with seasonality, and
humanitarian assistance delivery constraints.



Even though no county has been classified under famine (Phase 5) in this IPC update, the situation continues to
be very critical. In June-July 2017, in addition to approximately 45,000 people estimated to be facing
2
Humanitarian Catastrophe , an estimated 1.7 million people are likely to be facing food security emergency (IPC
Phase 4) - one-step below Famine on the IPC scale. This is based on most likely assumptions of continued armed
conflict, food shortages associated with seasonality, and humanitarian assistance delivery constraints. This
projected number in June-July 2017 is up from 1.0 million projected for February-April 2017 period in the last
IPC report.



While effective response was provided in the famine affected areas, thus avoiding what would have most likely
been significant loss of life due to the interaction of starvation and disease, the situation in central former Unity
remains extremely vulnerable with some populations in Humanitarian Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) in June-July
2017. Gains made in previously Famine-affected and Famine-risk counties must not be jeopardized through the
reallocation of humanitarian assistance to ongoing and developing acute food insecurity hotspots because the
affected populations’ livelihoods are effectively eroded thus leaving them heavily reliant on humanitarian
assistance. Should humanitarian assistance be compromised, the areas could easily slip into Famine again.



Of great concern is former Greater Jonglei State, where food security is rapidly deteriorating, predominantly in
the counties of Ayod, Canal/Pigi, Duk, Nyirol and Uror, which are facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food
insecurity, with Ayod having an estimated 20,000 people experiencing Humanitarian Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) at
least through July 2017. The conflict-related displacement of over 200,000 people from northern, central, and
eastern former Jonglei has severely disrupted livelihoods and access to social services, thus severely
undermining food security in the State. The situation has been further exacerbated by last year’s poor harvests
as well as the economic crisis that has eroded households’ purchasing power. The classification for Nyirol and
Urol is based on professional judgement of the IPC ERC and the South Sudan IPC Technical Working Group
(TWG) but not in accordance with the minimal evidence requirements of the IPC Protocols.

1

The official NBS population is used for classification. Out of the total 1.8 million refugees out of the country, only 470,000 have been deducted from the population
used in this IPC analysis. The rest of the refugees will be deducted before the next IPC workshop in August 2017 once their counties of origin are determined.
2

In IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe households are expected to have extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs even with full employment of coping strategies where
starvation and destitution are evident. Households may be in Phase 5 Catastrophe but the area may not be classified as Phase 5 Famine if widespread deaths and
acute malnutrition have not yet been expressed at the area level, either because the population facing Catastrophe is smaller than 20% of population, because of a
relatively limited geographical coverage of the dire situation, or because of the natural time delay expected between food deprivation, and collapse of livelihoods and
the consequential increase in acute malnutrition levels and death rates.



Greater Equatoria, and particularly some of the country’s most productive Greenbelt counties from Yei, Lainya,
Morobo, Kajo Keji and Magwi, are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of acute food
insecurity, driven largely by armed conflict that has had severe effects on agricultural activities and markets. Large
farming populations have been driven across the border into Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, severely inhibiting the 2016 harvest and causing large portions of the population to miss the first
planting season of 2017. There is a high likelihood that this population will also miss the second planting season
– a situation that will most likely result in a record high national cereal deficit in 2018.



The Western Bank of former Upper Nile state is experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, mainly in
Manyo, Panyikang, and Fashoda where large displacements have occurred due to ongoing armed conflict. This
has resulted in disruptions to livelihoods, markets, and access to humanitarian assistance.



Former Northern Bahr el Ghazal state is facing severe food insecurity caused by high food prices and diminished
household purchasing power. All counties except Aweil Center are experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute
food insecurity through July 2017. In former Western Bahr el Ghazal, a spike in armed conflict in the counties of
Wau and Raga has disrupted trade, displaced populations, and destroyed livelihoods.



Acute malnutrition remains a major public health emergency in several parts of South Sudan. A total of 12
SMART surveys were conducted between March-May 2017, and 10 showed Global Acute Malnutrition Weightfor-Height (GAM (WHZ)) prevalence above the WHO emergency threshold of 15%, with a peak of 26.1% in Duk,
bordering Extremely Critical classification. Alarming proxy GAM (MUAC) prevalence above 20% was observed in
Ayod, (Karmoun, Normanyang, and Kandak payams) between January-April 2017. Widespread fighting,
displacement and poor access to services, disease outbreaks, extremely poor diet (in terms of both quality and
quantity), low coverage of sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices are the key drivers of the high levels
of acute malnutrition across South Sudan. Levels of acute malnutrition are expected to deteriorate even further
as the peak lean season approaches in July 2017, with Mayendit, Aweil North, and Ayod projected to be at
Extreme Critical nutrition levels.

NOTES
The Global IPC Emergency Review Committee (ERC) was activated for this analysis and conducted a review of the IPC
analysis in the most critical counties, in support of the South Sudan IPC TWG.
